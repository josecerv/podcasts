Her unique path began as a therapist but led to a broader approach, combining psycho-spiritual methods to help others heal.</p><p><strong>What is Essential Soul Care?</strong></p><p>Essential Soul Care¬Æ is a psychospiritual model developed by DeeAnna, rooted in the use of essential oils and Oracle cards to support emotional and spiritual healing. DeeAnna found her calling through her own health challenges, which pushed her towards holistic practices, and ultimately, essential oils became her gateway to a deeper spiritual awakening. Essential oils, particularly in her work, act as a vibrational tool for personal and emotional growth.</p><p><strong>Incorporating Oracle Cards in Healing</strong></p><p>DeeAnna emphasizes the powerful role Oracle cards play in spiritual healing. While Tarot cards follow a structured system, Oracle cards allow for more intuitive freedom.

This deck integrates essential oils, crystals, and affirmations to provide deeper insight into one‚Äôs spiritual journey.</p><p><strong>Psychospiritual Tools in Practice</strong></p><p>DeeAnna uses her deck in therapeutic settings, allowing clients to explore emotions and experiences in a safe, guided way. Whether through journaling or affirmation exercises, the deck offers numerous ways for clients to engage in soul study and shadow work.</p><p><strong>The Power of Intuition and Metaphysical Healing</strong></p><p>Intuition plays a significant role in DeeAnna‚Äôs practice. As an intuitive, she explains how she integrates her psychic abilities with her counseling background. This combination allows her to deeply connect with clients and help them tap into their own inner wisdom.</p><p><strong>Blending Traditional Therapy with Metaphysical Tools</strong></p><p>DeeAnna encourages therapists and coaches to explore metaphysical tools like essential oils, Oracle cards, and spiritual practices in a way that complements their professional training. This blend offers clients a holistic approach to healing that addresses the mind, body, and spirit.</p><p><strong>Embracing Spiritual Practices for Healing</strong></p><p>DeeAnna Nagel‚Äôs work highlights the power of integrating spiritual and metaphysical tools into therapeutic practices.

On today's episode, we have the pleasure of hosting Takema Robinson, an inspiring leader and catalyst for social justice through corporate change.

Takema Robinson, founder and CEO of Converge, is not only at the forefront of advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, but she's also solidifying the importance of DEI within the very fabric of community dynamics. With a rich family history in civil rights activism and a personal education journey through Howard University, her expertise surrounds nurturing relationships with giant corporations to better serve communities of color, ensuring that diversity is more than just a buzzword, but rather a potent asset in every aspect of a business ecosystem.
""The key to unlocking real change is not to be punitive but to invite everyone to see diversity as a superpower, something that can positively influence all of us."" - Takema Robinson
Key takeaways from our conversation with Takema include:


 	Understanding that true commitment to DEI comes from ingrained company values, not just external mandates.
 	Recognizing the significant impact that the purchasing power of younger generations has on promoting socially conscious businesses.
 	The empowerment of employees in non-DEI aligned companies through collective actions such as walkouts and conversations around these critical topics.
 	Emphasizing the need for deep listening, observation, and trust-building for authentic engagements in conversations on diversity.
 	Focusing on collecting accurate data for inclusive analysis, utilizing third-party consultants when necessary to maintain authenticity.
 	Acknowledging the current legal and societal pushbacks affecting the progress of DEI, racial equality, and diversity efforts.
 	Addressing the cultural work necessary within schools and organizations to provide access to knowledge, development tools, and assessments.
 	Sharing the potential risks and rewards of advocating for equitable business relationships, as highlighted in Takema's personal experience with an NFL team.

This conversation takes us on a journey through Mandy's life, her discovery of Atelier training, and her dedication to bringing these classical art techniques back into the mainstream.</p> <p>The episode begins with Mandy sharing her experiences in the New York City area and her involvement with the <a href=""https://www.schoolofatelierarts.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">School of Atelier Arts</a>. She enlightens listeners on the history and significance of atelier training, drawing connections to legendary artists like Da Vinci and Rembrandt. Mandy explains how this form of education, once the cornerstone of artistic training, fell out of favour and was nearly lost to modernity.</p> <p>Mandy's personal story is both inspiring and revealing. She recounts her childhood visit to the Dayton Art Institute, where she first encountered realistic paintings, igniting her passion for art. Despite years of art education, she felt a disconnect between her skills and her aspirations, which changed upon discovering atelier training. Mandy then embarked on a journey to learn and subsequently share this nearly lost art form, striving to make it accessible to people worldwide.</p> <p>Throughout the conversation, Mandy highlights the relevance of atelier training in various fields, including animation and digital arts. She emphasizes the importance of visual literacy, comparing it to reading literacy, and advocates for the inclusion of realistic drawing and painting skills in modern education.</p> <p>This episode is packed with insights into Mandy's philosophy on art, her teaching methods, and her future endeavours, including potential book projects. This episode is not just a discussion about art; it's a revelation of how traditional techniques can profoundly impact modern artistic expression and education.</p> <h4>GREAT THINGS MANDY SAYS</h4> <p>""Art is not just a skill; it's a way of seeing the world.""</p> <p>""Every great artist was once a learner in an atelier.""</p> <p>""Visual literacy is as crucial as reading literacy.""</p> <p>""Rediscovering atelier training was like being told I could go to Hogwarts.""</p> <p>""Reviving classical art is the most rebellious thing an artist can do today.""</p> <h4>EPISODE HIGHLIGHTS</h4> <ul> <li>Mandy Theis's background and the mission of the School of Atelier Arts.</li> <li>The history and near extinction of atelier training in art.</li> <li>Personal anecdotes from Mandy's life that led her to pursue and teach atelier-style art.</li> <li>The impact of atelier training on modern art forms like animation and digital art.</li> <li>Discussion on the relevance of visual literacy in today's world.</li> <li>Mandy's future plans, including writing books and expanding her teaching platform.</li> </ul> <h4>LINKS FROM EPISODE</h4> <ul> <li>School of Atelier Arts (<a href=""https://schoolofatelierarts.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"">https://schoolofatelierarts.com</a>)</li> <li>The Florence Academy of Art (<a href=""https://florenceacademyofart.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"">https://florenceacademyofart.com</a>)</li> <li>Dayton Art Institute (<a href=""https://www.daytonartinstitute.org/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_new"">https://www.daytonartinstitute.org</a>)</li> <li><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/mandyfineartist/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Mandy Fine Artists</a> on Instagram</li> </ul> <hr /> <p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">*<em>When you buy a product using a link on this page, The RebelRebel Podcast receives a portion of the revenue from your qualifying purchases as part of the Amazon Associates Program.

Business,Entrepreneurs and Business Leaders,Donald J. Trump,M,FALSE,cc47a736c8e548a8a352dc84d9d09d55,https://feeds.podetize.com/rss/etG8UXUEU,The Lean to the Left Podcast,"Trump, Kennedy & Roadkill","One Nutcase Joins Another<br /><br />Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the man who had a<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-jr-wildest-campaign-moments"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> parasitic worm in his brain</a>, tried to get Kamala Harris to give him a job in her new administration, has dropped out of the presidential sweepstakes and is backing another nutcase, Donald J. Trump.<br /><br />They deserve each other and make a great match considering that Trump, while his brain apparently is worm-free, is about as wacko as you can get considering that during the Covid pandemic he tossed out the idea of injecting people with bleach to prevent the onset of the virus that's <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">claimed more than 1.2 million people</a>, mostly on his watch.<br /><br />And remember what he said in 2020: ""I don't take responsibility at all.""<br /><br />OK, so now worm-brain RFK Jr. has hooked up with Trump in his effort to derail the Harris-Walz march to the White House. It's a great fit, too, because Kennedy once sent a friend a pic of himself with what he claimed to be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-jr-wildest-campaign-moments"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a barbecued dog cooked on a spit</a>. So, he should get along great with Trump's VP runningmate JD Vance, who apparently has something against cats.<br /><br />A lot of women are pissed off at Vance for saying the U.S. is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.""<br /><br />Wow! That is really weird! How does that dovetail with all the joy the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz team is bringing to the presidential campaign -- and, really, the nation? It's especially weird, too, because it's the Republicans who are being run by corporate oligarchs <a href=""https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/05/10/trump-the-oil-barons-and-the-1b-question-00157373"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">who Trump is trying to hit up for campaign cash</a>, not the Democrats who are laser focused on helping the middle class.<br /><br />Anyway, the Democratic National Committee""s War Room has emailed a press release with reactions to the RFK Jr's support of Trump, as he apparently has given up hopes of working in the Harris administration because Kamala <a href=""https://youtu.be/F1NBqruRvP8?si=uUY_K--EjuLZH1ME"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">refused to take his call</a>. So, he's now switching to Trump where he must think he could find a job. Hopefully, however, it would not be as dog catcher.<br /><br />Here are some of the comments published by the War Room following Kennedy's endorsement of Trump:<br /><br />The Hill: <a href=""https://democrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90379082c3d9e6a03baf3f677&amp;id=7380ea425b&amp;e=ca4ecbd397"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">GOP strategist cautions Trump on joining forces with RFK Jr: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs kind of a looney tune‚Äô</a><br /><br />‚ÄúRepublican strategist Scott Jennings advised former President Trump to be careful now that he has seemingly joined forces with Robert F.

So what does he do‚Ä¶he goes and takes this endorsement from, you know, one of the sadder figures in American public life. A guy who clearly is just broken‚Ä¶you have two candidates that are supporting Putin, two candidates who would like to end the war in Ukraine so that Russia could take Ukraine, and you have two candidates who are against any mandatory vaccines in schools‚Ä¶that's the pro‚Äîpolio route.

I mean, people who take dead bear cubs to Central Park‚Ä¶ if you want that vote, go for it.‚Äù<br /><br /><a href=""https://democrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90379082c3d9e6a03baf3f677&amp;id=c9fb2a4a16&amp;e=ca4ecbd397"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Rubin on MSNBC‚Äôs The Saturday Show¬†</a><br /><br />‚ÄúI think the more people know about Bobby Kennedy, the more people who are sane will not want to vote for him. I think he is a perfect match for Donald Trump. And in fact, if I were JD Vance, I would stick by the phone, because he might be just the kind of guy that Trump would pull in as an October surprise. He is freakish in every sense of the word, whether it's picking up bear road kill or eating a barbecue dog. But much more seriously, he's a nut. He is a conspiracy nut. He's a racist.""<br /><br />And so, indeed, worm-brain RFK, Jr. is a perfect match for Trump as one nutcase joins another. Walz got it right.

On today's episode, we have the pleasure of hosting Takema Robinson, an inspiring leader and catalyst for social justice through corporate change.

Takema Robinson, founder and CEO of Converge, is not only at the forefront of advocating for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) in the corporate world, but she's also solidifying the importance of DEI within the very fabric of community dynamics. With a rich family history in civil rights activism and a personal education journey through Howard University, her expertise surrounds nurturing relationships with giant corporations to better serve communities of color, ensuring that diversity is more than just a buzzword, but rather a potent asset in every aspect of a business ecosystem.
""The key to unlocking real change is not to be punitive but to invite everyone to see diversity as a superpower, something that can positively influence all of us."" - Takema Robinson
Key takeaways from our conversation with Takema include:


 	Understanding that true commitment to DEI comes from ingrained company values, not just external mandates.
 	Recognizing the significant impact that the purchasing power of younger generations has on promoting socially conscious businesses.
 	The empowerment of employees in non-DEI aligned companies through collective actions such as walkouts and conversations around these critical topics.
 	Emphasizing the need for deep listening, observation, and trust-building for authentic engagements in conversations on diversity.
 	Focusing on collecting accurate data for inclusive analysis, utilizing third-party consultants when necessary to maintain authenticity.
 	Acknowledging the current legal and societal pushbacks affecting the progress of DEI, racial equality, and diversity efforts.
 	Addressing the cultural work necessary within schools and organizations to provide access to knowledge, development tools, and assessments.
 	Sharing the potential risks and rewards of advocating for equitable business relationships, as highlighted in Takema's personal experience with an NFL team.

Job scams are a pandemic. If a scammer hasn&#8217;t tried to lure you into a fake job, your neighbor or coworker has been exposed to one.

I was recently on the NPR podcast¬†<a href=""https://www.npr.org/podcasts/524588388/jazzed-about-work"">Jazzed About Work</a>¬†with host, author, and friend¬†<a href=""https://www.amazon.com/Think-Like-Entrepreneur-Act-Indispensable/dp/1632650177"">Beverly Jones¬†</a>to discuss job search trends and scams. This is my sixth appearance on her show. (She calls me a friend of the show; what an honor!). Scams are a pandemic, but job scams are<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In this clip, I discuss the upward trend of job scams merging into fake employers and coworkers. The current tech landscape allows people to appear as actual employers to lure job seekers and fake coworkers into fooling other coworkers of an actual company into accessing and scamming them out of company money.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Job seekers must be more discerning about giving anyone, including a fake recruiter or hiring manager, more information than needed. I recommend a couple of ways people can exercise discretion so they won‚Äôt be vulnerable to privacy breaches.<br />

Just have a self-awareness.</em></p></p><p>In today‚Äôs episode, I had the pleasure of speaking with Enid Futterman and John Isaacs, the co-founders of IMBY, a revolutionary platform for hyperlocal journalism. IMBY, which stands for ""In My Back Yard,"" empowers communities to create their own digital newspapers, promoting citizen journalism and community engagement.</p><p>Enid explained, ‚ÄúIMBY is a hyperlocal network of websites for citizen journalism. It allows any community to create its own digital newspaper.‚Äù This model not only fills the gap left by the decline of traditional local newspapers but also provides a space for community members to share news, opinions, and events directly relevant to their locality.</p><p>John elaborated on the origins of IMBY, sharing how their initial success with a local community magazine in Hudson, New York, inspired them to create a scalable platform. ‚ÄúThe demise of local journalism is not just an absence of information but also a threat to democracy. Local news plays an enormously important role and its diminishment is a serious issue for the preservation of democracy,‚Äù John emphasized. This sentiment underscores the critical role IMBY aims to play in sustaining informed and connected communities.</p><p>One of the most compelling aspects of IMBY is its support for citizen activists. Enid highlighted, ‚ÄúOne of the biggest uses is among citizen activists who are trying to advocate for a cause, often aligned with our mission to build community with the values of localism, sustainability, and justice.‚Äù</p><p>Currently, IMBY is running a crowdfunding campaign on Honeycomb Credit to expand its reach. Enid noted, ‚ÄúHoneycomb's focus on crowdsourcing local capital aligns perfectly with our mission to crowdsource local news.‚Äù</p><p>IMBY‚Äôs innovative approach not only addresses the loss of local newspapers but also reinvigorates the essence of community journalism. Their platform represents a beacon of hope for communities striving to stay informed and engaged in an era of media consolidation and declining local news sources.</p><p>Through platforms like IMBY, the power of the press is truly placed back in the hands of the people, fostering a more democratic and connected society.</p><p>AI Episode Summary</p><p>1. Devin introduces IMBY, a platform for hyperlocal journalism developed by Enid Futterman and John Isaacs.</p><p>2. Enid describes IMBY as a network of websites for citizen journalism, allowing communities to create their own digital newspapers.</p><p>3. John shares the history and motivation behind IMBY, stemming from their experience with a local quarterly magazine in Columbia County, New York.</p><p>4. IMBY aims to address the decline of local newspapers by empowering citizens to become content creators, thereby preserving local journalism.</p><p>5. Enid emphasizes that anyone can post various types of content on IMBY, including news stories, opinion pieces, and event announcements, fortifying community advocacy.</p><p>6. John highlights that the decline in local journalism affects democracy, making platforms like IMBY crucial for maintaining local dialogues and informed communities.</p><p>7. Devin speaks about the cultural shift towards conglomerates owning local papers and how IMBY counters this by providing a decentralized model for local journalism.</p><p>8. Enid explains that IMBY is currently funded through local advertising and is exploring additional revenue streams such as subscriptions and merchandising.</p><p>9. John and Enid discuss their successful crowdfunding campaign on Honeycomb Credit, which aligns with IMBY's focus on crowdsourcing local news.</p><p>10. The show ends with Enid and John discussing their ""superpowers"" of love and self-awareness, emphasizing the importance of passion and self-reflection in achieving personal and professional fulfillment.</p><p>How to Develop Love As a Superpower</p><p>Summary: Enid's superpower is her profound love for what she does. This love drives her dedication to hyperlocal journalism and her mission to build community through IMBY. She believes that genuine passion and care for one's work are essential for overcoming challenges and achieving meaningful success.</p><p>Developing Enid's Superpower:</p><p>1. Find Your Passion: Identify work that you deeply care about and are passionate about.</p><p>2. Stay Tenacious: Understand that love for what you do can help you persist through challenges.</p><p>3. Align Values: Ensure that your work aligns with your values and beliefs, making it more fulfilling.</p><p>4. Move Away from Unfulfilling Work: Have the courage to leave work that doesn‚Äôt resonate with you, even if it‚Äôs lucrative.</p><p>By following Enid's example and advice, you can make love for your work a skill. With practice and effort, you could make it a superpower that enables you to do more good in the world.</p><p><em>Remember, however, that research into success suggests that building on your own superpowers is more important than creating new ones or overcoming weaknesses. You do you!</em></p><p>How to Develop Self-Awareness As a Superpower</p><p>Summary: John's superpower is his strong sense of self-awareness. He leverages his diverse experiences and philosophical background to stay focused on meaningful work that benefits society. By maintaining a balanced perspective and reflecting on his actions, John contributes significantly to the success and impact of IMBY.</p><p>Developing John's Superpower:</p><p>1. Practice Self-Reflection: Regularly take time to reflect on your actions and decisions without judgment.</p><p>2. Maintain Balance: Develop a balanced perspective by observing yourself from an outside view.</p><p>3. Stay True to Yourself: Avoid being driven by external pressures; focus on what genuinely matters to you.</p><p>4.

<p>From competing in the 1500 meters at the 2004 Olympics to overcoming the challenges of marathons in Valencia and Rotterdam, Roberto Mandje's journey is filled with resilience, adaptation, and a relentless pursuit of growth. At the age of 34, he made the pivotal decision to transition away from professional running, embracing a new chapter as a hybrid athlete and a dedicated father.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roberto's story isn't just about the highs and lows of competition; it's about finding joy and meaning in every step, setting an example for his kids, and inspiring others through coaching and public speaking. On this episode, we explore the lessons he's learned, the influence of his supportive mother, his unique perspective on life's chapters, and the universal language of sports that transcends cultures.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Tune is as we discuss the importance of mindset, belief in human capability, and the power of setting goals. This episode promises a wealth of insights for runners and dreamers alike. So, lace up your shoes, and let's dive in! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roberto Mandje was a professional runner from 2004 to 2016. During that time, he competed in the 1,500 meters at the 2004 Olympics, the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, and the XTERRA Trail World Championship, where he placed seventh in 2012 and fifth in 2013.<br />He started coaching both individuals and groups in 2005 and in 2016 he joined New York Road Runners. Roberto has coached runners of all ages, as young as middle school, both remotely and in person. He also coached runners as part of his (at the time) sponsors‚Äô camps and running schools/clinics, such as Nike, Newton Running, and PowerBar, amongst others.¬†</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Roberto is currently on a quest to enjoy and experience running in new and different ways, while still coaching and inspiring others to reach their running and fitness goals. In 2023, Roberto paced several marathons and half marathons, and also captained a team for the TSP (The Speed Project) Atacama, a 500KM race across the Atacama desert in Chile.¬†

<br />
Mike me cuenta de d√≥nde sali√≥ la idea de Join a Join junto a su hermano gemelo Steve, c√≥mo llegaron al modelo de negocios de rentar casas a corto plazo, los retos de manejar dos tipos de clientes, los anfitriones que alquilan sus casas y quienes reservan esas casas, y c√≥mo han utilizado el contenido org√°nico en las redes sociales para crecer la empresa. <br />
<br />
Tambi√©n hablamos sobre las ense√±anzas que obtuvo durante su crianza en una familia china, los retos de lanzar una aplicaci√≥n y c√≥mo dise√±aron la nueva integraci√≥n de inteligencia artificial en Join a Join.¬† <br />
<br />
Tres ""takeaways"" de este episodio:<br />
1. Muchas personas est√°n enfocadas en ver el resultado que tiene la persona o la compa√±√≠a hoy d√≠a, pero no miran lo que hicieron durante el proceso.<br />
2. T√∫ tienes que crecer como individuo para poder obtener resultados que nunca has obtenido.<br />
3. No le tengas miedo a lanzarte porque si no funciona, por lo menos vas a poder mirar hac√≠a atr√°s y saber que lo intentaste.<br />

Business,Media Professionals,Donald J. Trump,M,FALSE,cc47a736c8e548a8a352dc84d9d09d55,https://feeds.podetize.com/rss/etG8UXUEU,The Lean to the Left Podcast,"Trump, Kennedy & Roadkill","One Nutcase Joins Another<br /><br />Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the man who had a<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-jr-wildest-campaign-moments"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank""> parasitic worm in his brain</a>, tried to get Kamala Harris to give him a job in her new administration, has dropped out of the presidential sweepstakes and is backing another nutcase, Donald J. Trump.<br /><br />They deserve each other and make a great match considering that Trump, while his brain apparently is worm-free, is about as wacko as you can get considering that during the Covid pandemic he tossed out the idea of injecting people with bleach to prevent the onset of the virus that's <a href=""https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us/"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">claimed more than 1.2 million people</a>, mostly on his watch.<br /><br />And remember what he said in 2020: ""I don't take responsibility at all.""<br /><br />OK, so now worm-brain RFK Jr. has hooked up with Trump in his effort to derail the Harris-Walz march to the White House. It's a great fit, too, because Kennedy once sent a friend a pic of himself with what he claimed to be <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/article/2024/aug/23/rfk-jr-wildest-campaign-moments"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">a barbecued dog cooked on a spit</a>. So, he should get along great with Trump's VP runningmate JD Vance, who apparently has something against cats.<br /><br />A lot of women are pissed off at Vance for saying the U.S. is being run by Democrats, corporate oligarchs and ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices they've made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.""<br /><br />Wow! That is really weird! How does that dovetail with all the joy the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz team is bringing to the presidential campaign -- and, really, the nation? It's especially weird, too, because it's the Republicans who are being run by corporate oligarchs <a href=""https://www.politico.com/newsletters/power-switch/2024/05/10/trump-the-oil-barons-and-the-1b-question-00157373"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">who Trump is trying to hit up for campaign cash</a>, not the Democrats who are laser focused on helping the middle class.<br /><br />Anyway, the Democratic National Committee""s War Room has emailed a press release with reactions to the RFK Jr's support of Trump, as he apparently has given up hopes of working in the Harris administration because Kamala <a href=""https://youtu.be/F1NBqruRvP8?si=uUY_K--EjuLZH1ME"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">refused to take his call</a>. So, he's now switching to Trump where he must think he could find a job. Hopefully, however, it would not be as dog catcher.<br /><br />Here are some of the comments published by the War Room following Kennedy's endorsement of Trump:<br /><br />The Hill: <a href=""https://democrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90379082c3d9e6a03baf3f677&amp;id=7380ea425b&amp;e=ca4ecbd397"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">GOP strategist cautions Trump on joining forces with RFK Jr: ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs kind of a looney tune‚Äô</a><br /><br />‚ÄúRepublican strategist Scott Jennings advised former President Trump to be careful now that he has seemingly joined forces with Robert F.

So what does he do‚Ä¶he goes and takes this endorsement from, you know, one of the sadder figures in American public life. A guy who clearly is just broken‚Ä¶you have two candidates that are supporting Putin, two candidates who would like to end the war in Ukraine so that Russia could take Ukraine, and you have two candidates who are against any mandatory vaccines in schools‚Ä¶that's the pro‚Äîpolio route.

So I would just caution, careful, careful.‚Äù<br /><br />Finney: ‚ÄúIf you want to have that endorsement, I'm perfectly happy for you to because that's fine. I mean, people who take dead bear cubs to Central Park‚Ä¶ if you want that vote, go for it.‚Äù<br /><br /><a href=""https://democrats.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=90379082c3d9e6a03baf3f677&amp;id=c9fb2a4a16&amp;e=ca4ecbd397"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jennifer Rubin on MSNBC‚Äôs The Saturday Show¬†</a><br /><br />‚ÄúI think the more people know about Bobby Kennedy, the more people who are sane will not want to vote for him. I think he is a perfect match for Donald Trump. And in fact, if I were JD Vance, I would stick by the phone, because he might be just the kind of guy that Trump would pull in as an October surprise. He is freakish in every sense of the word, whether it's picking up bear road kill or eating a barbecue dog. But much more seriously, he's a nut. He is a conspiracy nut. He's a racist.""<br /><br />And so, indeed, worm-brain RFK, Jr. is a perfect match for Trump as one nutcase joins another. Walz got it right.

On this episode of what we call ""Grace Talk,"" I join my friends,  where curiosity kindles conversation and faith ignites in a blaze of impassioned dialogue. In Episode 9, ""Is Your House on Fire?,"" join Michael Stamps, Chris Payne, Cory Lee, and special guest Kim Lee as they delve into the vibrant flames of spiritual fervor and the fervent quest for divine purpose.

Witness an enthralling exploration of the desires God plants within us, reflected through the parable of the talents and the calling to be vessels of honor. Listen in as our speakers unravel the secrets of a life steeped in service, exemplified by the remarkable longevity of figures like Charles Stanley.

Immerse yourself in the transformative power of testimony, with awe-inspiring tales like that of a young Brazilian girl whose words transcended language barriers to touch hearts and save souls. Find encouragement in the truth that every act of faith, no matter how seemingly small, is vital in the grand design of sowing, watering, and reaping.

As the conversation deepens, our speakers ignite a call to action for youth and elders alike to keep the fire of faith burning bright. Discover the profound impact of Acts-like empowerment, the essential role of community, and the guardedness of heart and mind. Engage your spirit in the pursuit of daily renewal, openness to the Holy Spirit, and an unquenchable thirst for spiritual growth.

Infused with personal stories of faith and surrenders, such as the journey of a zealous musician and a 14-year-old's daring quest for more of the Holy Spirit, this episode is a beacon of inspiration. It's an invitation to boldness, to ""tell it all,"" and to stand sturdy in faith through life's trials.

Don your spiritual armor and join the 'hall of miracles' as we traverse pathways anew, reminding each listener of the wonders the Lord has wrought and the incredible promise that awaits a 'yes' given to God. It's more than a podcast‚Äîit's a spiritual conflagration destined to set your heart ablaze. Tune in and let the fire rise within you.
I would love to hear from you; what's your key takeaway from the discussion?

She has spent over 24 years at Ralph Lauren, surviving my tenure, and moving up through the ranks, starting as a General Manager, and in her most recent role, as SVP of retail stores from North America. Sharonda has always worked directly with the stores and fully understands the frontline experience where her focus has been to create the best customer experience and the appropriate staff to support it.</p><p><strong>Ron Thurston</strong> is the founder of OSSY, a platform that aggregates store employee talent from sales associate to leadership roles, enabling retailers and brands to easily access Aussie's labor pool. Ron is also the author of the Amazon bestseller, Retail Pride, championing joy and success in the service industry. Ron's book draws on his experience and store leadership roles with Intermix, San Laurent, Tory Burch, Apple, West Elm, and Gap. Ron also hosts a podcast, Retail in America.</p><p><strong>Mike Myers</strong> is the co-founder and CEO of Reflex and has spent the last decade building early stage companies as both a founder and an early stage venture. Reflex works with some of the top brands in retail today and helps brands leverage a flexible labor model to drive store performance. Retailers use Reflex to connect with experienced on-demand retail store associates and to flex their labor models to support the real time needs of the business.</p><p>Key Takeaways from this episode are:</p><p>1.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Evolution of Retail Staffing Post-COVID</strong>: The post-COVID environment has significantly changed the landscape of retail staffing. Retailers have had to adapt rapidly to evolving business models, leading to challenges in finding and retaining talent. Competing for local talent, dealing with the gig economy, upskilling rapidly, and identifying the right candidate profiles have become significant hurdles.</p><p>2.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Shift Towards On-Demand Flexible Talent</strong>: The emergence of platforms like Reflex has transformed the staffing model. They facilitate connecting retailers with on-demand, experienced retail talent, allowing for real-time staffing adjustments based on business needs rather than fixed hiring plans.</p><p>3.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Tech-Driven Recruitment Solutions</strong>: Reflex, as a tech platform, streamlines the staffing process. It provides a platform for retailers to access a pool of vetted workers for various roles, from back of house to front of house, offering flexibility in scheduling and facilitating worker-retailer feedback through ratings and reviews.</p><p>4.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Challenges and Benefits of Adopting New Staffing Models</strong>: Trust remains a significant obstacle for retailers adopting flexible staffing solutions like Reflex. However, the platform's benefits, including reducing turnover costs, addressing immediate staffing needs, and potential cost savings in comparison to traditional hiring and retention methods, make a compelling case for its adoption.</p><p>5.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Changing the Perception of Retail Jobs</strong>: The introduction of platforms like Ossy seeks to redefine the hiring process, especially for the retail workforce. It aims to replace traditional resumes with dynamic digital profiles, utilizing AI-driven algorithms to match candidates with suitable retail roles, focusing on soft skills, empathy, and curiosity, ultimately changing how individuals perceive and access retail job opportunities.</p><p>6.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Industry Insights through Trade Shows and Networking:</strong> Sharonda gains industry knowledge and stays updated by attending trade shows like NRF. and various others. Networking through LinkedIn and connections with individuals like Ron and Mike allows her to stay informed about innovative solutions.</p><p>7.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Innovative Solutions in Staffing:</strong> Both Ossy and Reflex offer platforms that provide accessible solutions through mobile applications and digital platforms, simplifying the staffing process compared to traditional methods like phone calls or emails. These platforms offer an automated and convenient way to connect available staff to positions.</p><p>8.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Integration of AI:</strong> Both Ossy and Reflex are integrating AI into their platforms. Ossy aims to replace the traditional resume with a more interactive and multimedia-based platform for job seekers, while Reflex employs AI in the background to enhance the operational experience for workers and retailers without overtly marketing it as an AI platform.</p><p>9.¬†¬†¬†¬†<strong>Marketing Challenges and Strategies:</strong> Both platforms face marketing challenges in a crowded space. They are using strategies like word-of-mouth referrals, industry events (such as Shop Talk and NRF), and social media channels like TikTok and Instagram for worker acquisition. They also emphasize thought leadership, sharing insights, and building a presence within the retail industry.</p><p>10.¬†<strong>Funding and Business Challenges:</strong> Ossy is self-funded with an intention to create a new category, while Reflex has raised $12 million in funding and is focused on delivering for retail partners, launching new markets, and scaling worker experiences. Building the right tech infrastructure and understanding the time investment required has been a significant challenge for both platforms.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Alexa reports on racial health equity for Word in Black, a newsroom that frames narratives and fosters solutions for racial inequities in America. It was founded after the murder of George Floyd. She previously worked for the Memphis Commercial Appeal and also writes about maternal health. 

Alexa talked about her early journalism origin story and how going to Howard University shaped her as a journalist. She shared her experience as a doula, helping women through labor and baby delivery. And she was frank about how covering breaking news stories in Memphis impacted her mental health.

We went through different examples of her work, including a story about black maternity care deserts and an interview with the family of Henrietta Lacks (the subject of a book and movie about stolen cells used for medical research). She explained that her goal was to create a catalog of how racism impacted health carte in America and discussed her passion for ethics and training in trauma reporting.

Ginny has spent the past two decades sharing her heart with listeners and readers as a singer/songwriter, author, teacher, and advocate. Her new book, Singing in the Dark, shows how we can experience light in the middle of our suffering. You don‚Äôt want to miss this episode because we discuss the importance of returning to God and surrendering to His plans, even when we don't have all the answers. She emphasizes the need for community and how it has played a significant role in her life, as well as the power of gratitude and establishing rhythms in our relationship with God.

Highlights and takeaways from the conversation:

 Starting over is a natural part of life, but it can be challenging and scary. But it's important to return to God and surrender to His plans.
Community is essential for navigating life's challenges. Building relationships and finding support from others can bring healing and growth.
Gratitude is a powerful tool for refocusing our minds and finding peace in difficult circumstances. Taking time to thank God and reflect on His goodness can bring perspective and hope.
Establishing rhythms in our relationship with God is crucial. Setting aside time for reading Scripture, prayer, and reflection helps us stay connected to Him and grow in our faith.
 ""What would it look like for me to do something new?""
 ""Surrender is not easy, but it is how we draw closer to our loving Heavenly Father.""
 ""God helps those who help themselves. Thank the Lord that is not in the Bible.""

Financial discipline is one of James‚Äô strong suits as he was previously CEO of USA Truck that was successfully sold to DB Schenker&nbsp;in September 2022 for $31.72 per share in cash.&nbsp;</p><p>It‚Äôs not just success that James brings to Kodiak, it‚Äôs a deep understanding of economic cycles and how those impact operations and cash-flow. In the depths of 2008 financial crisis, James served as Division CFO at Washington Mutual. The bank was ultimately acquired by J.P. Morgan Chase because of their sub-prime mortgage portfolio. During the banking crisis James saw first hand how one division that takes on too much risk can sink an entire corporation.&nbsp;</p><p><em>I learned about this dichotomy of you can be widely successful and still fail as a team.&nbsp;‚Äì James Reed</em></p><p>Being in banking is about risk management and this is a skill that influences how James runs operations at Kodiak. To manage risk, the team matters. You have to hire the best to mitigate the risk and limit your potential downside exposure. Including planning and forecasting as the economic environments can change suddenly.&nbsp;</p><p>As we prepare to enter 2024, we could be entering a potential recessionary environment depending on the actions of the Federal Reserve and how the economy reacts to those actions.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Well run companies plan for upsides, downsides including recessions as part of their on-going operations.&nbsp;‚Äì James Reed</em></p><p>Kodiak is planning for this potential economic environment as was an economic growth environment. Planning for all economic environments and what the potential impact will be on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.roadtoautonomy.com/building-autonomous-trucking-business/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">Kodiak business</a>&nbsp;is one of the core strengths that James brings to the team from his years of financial experience.&nbsp;</p><p>The Kodiak business is not a pure-play autonomous trucking business, it‚Äôs a diversified business with a defense division because of the ability of their autonomy stack to work in unstructured environments. On December 5th, it was announced that Kodiak has been awarded a $49.9 million, 24-month United States Department of Defense agreement to help automate future U.S. Army ground vehicles. Moving forward, defense will be a key pillar of the Kodiak business.&nbsp;</p><p><em>We plan to become a defacto prime in the autonomous software space.&nbsp;‚Äì James Reed</em></p><p>In 2024, Kodiak will continue focus on commercialization, industry partnerships and driver-out operations on public roads.&nbsp;</p><p>Wrapping up the conversation, James shares his vision for the future of Kodiak which includes a potential IPO.</p><p><br /></p><p><em>Recorded on Tuesday, December 12, 2023</em></p><p>--------</p><p><em>About The Road to Autonomy</em></p><p>The Road to Autonomy¬Æ is a leading source of data, insight and commentary on autonomous vehicles/trucks and the emerging autonomy economy‚Ñ¢.

Cristina Alaimo and Jannis Kalliniko discussed their book ""Data Rules,"" emphasizing the sociological aspects of data and its impact on organizations and society.

Cloud revenues were also examined, with major tech companies reporting strong growth despite economic headwinds.

Topics covered include:
üìå Why is it important to look at data in a wider, socioeconomic context? How can we conceive of data as a social function?
üìå  How has data influenced the social structures and people around them?
üìå  Why is security still broken today?
üìå  The issues involved in measuring ROI on generative AI
üìå  Does generative AI hype match what's happening with companies at this point?

<p><br /></p>
<p>With an impressive academic and professional background in social services, Lorna Little, MSW is intimately connected to the challenges and needs of families, particularly youth parents, youth in foster care and individuals impacted by adoption. Since 2018, she has served as the President and CEO of St. Anne's Family Services. In 1997, the professional turned unexpectedly - an unimaginably - personal.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;It's out now.&quot; With those three simple words, Lorna learned from her mother that she was adopted. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But only by one parent.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Your dad is your dad biologically. But I'm not your biological mother.&quot;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A living family secret swaddled in the shame of infidelity, infertility, interracial romance and stigma took Lorna on an international search for the truth of her origins that spanned years. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lorna's search is filled with so many twists, turns and moments of synchronicity that her reunion can only be called Divine. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her memoir, <em>Mum's the Word! </em>(we love a good double entendre!) is not only a journey through family secrets and relationships; it's a map of sorts for other late discovery adoptees navigating their own healing journeys through what Lorna describes as the complex &quot;blessing&quot; of adoption. </p>

You bet! Our guest Gerette Buglion, of Living Cult Free, shares her experiences with 18 years in a dream cult. Gerette is passionate about reclaiming her own life and helping others to reclaim theirs.
I start by reading a short passage from my book in progress about the vulnerability of dreamers when they ask for support around their dreams. Gerette tells two of her dreams and how they were interpreted by her ex-teacher in a way that belittled her tender nature. She goes on to tell a new dream in which someone negates her own vivid experience of seeing a white bear.
After the break, we talk about gaslighting and how it can be healthy for people in relationship to have different perceptions. We end with Gerette talking about the clarifying nature that writing about a lived experience brings and describing the ongoing and drop-in writing groups that she offers, plus the upcoming online panel with guests Sarah Edmonson, Daniel Shaw and others
Gerette is author of two books &#8220;An Everyday Cult&#8221; and &#8220;Writing to Reckon Journal.&#8221;
BIO: Gerette Buglion wants to live in a world where cult leaders, narcissistic abusers, and manipulative marketing techniques are spotted, called out, and silenced, creating more opportunities for nourishing relationships to flourish. Her work as educator centers on liberation from coercive control and supporting the integrative power of writing for survivors of cultic relationships through Writing to Reckon‚Ñ¢ programs.

From there, Chanel and her friends did a crowd fund and raised $90,000, which then help build a website and set up the petition teachusconsent.com.</p> <p>Chanel encouraged girls and women to leave their stories of sexual assault by naming only the perpetrators age and school.

Anand believes the industry is on the cusp of a breakthrough, moving from fragmented point solutions to horizontal intelligence applicable across various robotic applications.</p><p>Vayu‚Äôs approach focuses on developing high-quality, low-cost autonomous systems. Vayu achieves this through innovative passive sensing technology, which extracts multiple properties of light beyond just intensity, inspired by biological systems. This method allows for robust perception without the energy inefficiency and detectability issues of active sensors like LiDARS.</p><p>The company utilizes low-power&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.roadtoautonomy.com/world-runs-on-arm/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">ARM processors</a>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.roadtoautonomy.com/platform-autonomy/"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"" target=""_blank"">expensive GPU clusters</a>, significantly reducing both cost and energy consumption. This efficiency enables Vayu‚Äôs robots to operate for 6-8 hours on a single battery charge, dramatically lowering the carbon footprint of goods movement.</p><p>Anand emphasizes the importance of foundation models in robotics, but highlights the challenges of data scarcity and edge computing. Vayu addresses these issues through intelligent use of synthetic data generated in gaming-like simulators, focusing on domain-independent aspects of movement and interaction.</p><p>The conversation touches on the broad applicability of Vayu‚Äôs technology, from defense to various commercial sectors. Deploying the same intelligence across multiple applications creates significant growth and business opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>As a business Vayu is focused on drastically reducing hardware costs, and building robotics that can transform a capital-intensive industry to one with rapid return on investment. He envisions Vayu monetizing its intelligence and hardware reference designs rather than becoming a robotics operations business.</p><p>In closing the conversation Anand suggests robotics are entering a golden age, driven by new tools and the ability to solve real economic problems. He encourages listeners and viewers to recognize this potential while remaining grounded in addressing the hard technical challenges of edge computing, cost reduction, and energy efficiency.</p><p><br /></p><p><em>Recorded on Thursday, June 27, 2024</em></p><p><br /></p><p>Episode Chapters</p><p>0:00 Current State of the Robotics Market</p><p>4:58 Cost of Sensors</p><p>9:27 Cost of Labor Accelerating the Adoption of Autonomy</p><p>13:29 Value of Robotic Autonomy&nbsp;</p><p>15:19 Lower Power Chips vs GPUs</p><p>17:03 Energy Efficiency&nbsp;</p><p>21:03 Passive Sensing&nbsp;</p><p>27:43 AI Foundational Models</p><p>31:40 Simulation&nbsp;</p><p>37:45 Vayu Business</p><p><br /></p><p><em>--------</em></p><p><em>About The Road to Autonomy</em></p><p>The Road to Autonomy¬Æ is a leading source of data, insight and commentary on autonomous vehicles/trucks and the emerging autonomy economy‚Ñ¢.

Heartstrings ‚Äì First Guitars, is a collection of memories from a variety of musicians, famous, semi-famous, up and coming, anonymous, or otherwise, about the guitar they learned on, the first guitar they bought with their own money, the first ‚Äúgood‚Äù guitar they owned, or the beloved first-line guitar that accompanied them on first songs, first shows, first tours, or first recordings.



These short, narrative pieces, tied together with first-time author Sean Barrette‚Äôs memories of a life and career spent immersed in music, tell a story that demonstrates that, no matter the guitar player, they all have this first guitar story and love to tell it. It's the thread that ties all guitar players together, but these stories also provide insight into the very beginnings of many of the musical artists we love. It may even provide insight into the guitar player who lives with you. Or encourage someone to pick up a guitar and get playing themselves.



With first guitar stories by: Gordon Lightfoot, Bruce Cockburn, David Knopfler, Colin Linden (Blackie & the Rodeo Kings), Johnny Hickman (Cracker), Rob Baker (Tragically Hip), Paul Langlois (Tragically Hip), Gord Sinclair (Tragically Hip), Tom Wilson (Blackie & the Rodeo Kings), Kevn Kinney (Drivin & Cryin), Liona Boyd, Leeroy Stagger, Moe Berg and Kris Abbott (The Pursuit of Happiness), Blair Packham (The Jitters), Rik Emmett (Triumph), Finny McConnell (The Mahones), Ron Hawkins (Lowest of the Low), Dave Genn (54-40), Skye Wallace, Alun Piggins, Mark Stuart, Stacey Earle, Chris and Eleanor Masterson (The Mastersons), Preston and Alan Glass, Barney Bentall, Sean Kelly (Crash Kelly), Mr. Zero (The Kings), Jaimee Harris, Andrew Hyatt, Terry Draper (Klaatu), Dan ‚ÄúChewy‚Äù Mongrain (Voi Vod), Sal Costa (My Darkest Days, Bonds of Mara), Michael Mckenzie (Lowest of the Low), Fran√ßois Lamoureux, Jordon Zadorozny (Blinker the Star), Ed Ringwald (Gordon Lightfoot), Joel Plaskett, Neil Osborne (54-40), Carl Harvey (Toots & the Maytals), Don Ross, Mike Turner (Our Lady Peace), Darrell Scott, Stephen Fearing (Blackie & the Rodeo Kings), Ethan Ives (Car Seat Headrest), Jeffrey Trott (Sheryl Crow), Julian Taylor, David Pulkingham, Brian Howes (DDT), Gary Lee Connor (Screaming Trees), Johnette Napolitano (Concrete Blonde), Pete Yorn, Gordie Johnson (Big Sugar), David Baerwald, Pete Droge and Elaine Summers (The Sinners), Serena Ryder, Myles Zuniga (Fastball), Jim Cuddy (Blue Rodeo), Hayes Carll, Stuart Cameron (Crash Test Dummies), Myles Goodwin (April Wine), Brian and Bruce Good (The Good Brothers), Adrian Eccleston (Drake, The Weeknd), and many more.



Heartstrings ‚Äì First Guitars is a feel-good read that will draw people in, whether guitar players, other musicians, or music fans, and allow them to feel the enthusiasm and gratitude towards music shared by this international cast of individuals, some legendary, others just regular people who love to play, and every kind of guitar player in between.

Locked-in syndrome might be a condition you have heard of - but may not know much about.
This episode will help you understand more about locked-in syndrome and what it is like to live with or support a family member with the condition.
To shed a light on the topic, Georgie Tyler-Collings joins Elizabeth and Julia to tell them about her inspiring dad, David Collings.
He was left with locked-in syndrome after suffering an ischemic brain stem stroke aged 59 while on holiday in France.
Although paralysed, David is fully cognitive and communicates using his eyes.
Alongside her wider family, Georgie talks about what happened, how they got him home to Sheffield from France and the impact it has had on her and other family members.
She says: ""It's tough, but if my family can do it, then you can too"".
Before his stroke, David would take part in various cycling and swimming challenges - and his motivation for a challenge has not waned.
In 2018, he used a special motorised bike to cycle two hours a day for 80 days from his care home and, using the same method, he is currently clocking up the miles to get to New Zealand.
This is a story of a family coming together in crisis for a special man, the ups and downs, the impact and loss. But it is also a story of plenty of laughs and support to help David live a happy life with locked-in syndrome.

<p><br /></p>
<p>With an impressive academic and professional background in social services, Lorna Little, MSW is intimately connected to the challenges and needs of families, particularly youth parents, youth in foster care and individuals impacted by adoption. Since 2018, she has served as the President and CEO of St. Anne's Family Services. In 1997, the professional turned unexpectedly - an unimaginably - personal.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;It's out now.&quot; With those three simple words, Lorna learned from her mother that she was adopted. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>But only by one parent.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>&quot;Your dad is your dad biologically. But I'm not your biological mother.&quot;</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>A living family secret swaddled in the shame of infidelity, infertility, interracial romance and stigma took Lorna on an international search for the truth of her origins that spanned years. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Lorna's search is filled with so many twists, turns and moments of synchronicity that her reunion can only be called Divine. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Her memoir, <em>Mum's the Word! </em>(we love a good double entendre!) is not only a journey through family secrets and relationships; it's a map of sorts for other late discovery adoptees navigating their own healing journeys through what Lorna describes as the complex &quot;blessing&quot; of adoption. </p>

<p>Born in 1944, between the German and British colonial periods of the Gold Coast (1821-1957), El Anatsui has engaged critically with the impact of colonialism across Africa. He is well-known for his large-scale, sculptural wall hangings made by stitching-together of thousands of aluminium metal bottle tops; whisky, gin, and brandy were alcohols introduced into Ghana and Nigeria during the 15th century as ‚Äòtrade spirits‚Äô, first exchanged for gold, then enslaved people, becoming the second highest import into Africa after textiles.¬†The artist, like his work, is considered a ‚Äòproduct‚Äô of their time. Despite major displays at the Tate Modern, Royal Academy, and British Museum in London, which have made him a ‚Äòhousehold name‚Äô, there was yet to be a significant exploration of his practice in the UK - until now.</p>
<p><em>Scottish Mission Book Depot Keta </em>covers five decades of El Anatsui‚Äôs work, starting with the place of the exhibition itself, the University of Edinburgh's Old College building. Curator Tessa Giblin talks about working with the artist to shape his 'nomadic' installations, uncovering historic and contemporary connections. We discuss El‚Äôs childhood memories of making, and the indelible memory of Scotland‚Äôs role in the colonial project, with the export of organised religion and Christian missionaries. Tessa describes tapestries like Woman‚Äôs Cloth (1999-2002), inspired by Kente fabrics, the weaving traditions of fisherpeople, and the yellow clay or earth of the natural environment. From these ‚Äòtopographical‚Äô works, we discuss his early works in wood, carving out or mapping the straight-line borders imposed upon Africa.</p>
<p>Tessa shares how El recreates ‚Äòtraditional‚Äô Adinkra symbols, to highlight both the loss of cultural identity, and work of artists in telling new, transnational stories. From the artist‚Äôs watery works at the Guggenheim Bilbao, we make connections with the city‚Äôs own volcanic landscape, revealing their intergenerational work with climate crises - and younger contemporary artists.</p>

The book highlights the importance of locality and emotions in shaping Muslim identities, politics, and belonging in Rampur. The book shows that we need to move beyond such homogeneous categories of nation and region, in order to comprehend local dynamics that allow a better and closer understanding of the historical re-negotiations of politics and identities by Muslims in South Asia. This is the first comprehensive English-language monograph on the local history and politics of Rampur princely state, based on Persian, Pashto, Urdu, Hindi, and English archives and oral histories of Rampuris. The book provides insights into the various facets of the political, economic, religious, literary, socio-cultural, and affective history of Rampur and Rampuris in India and Pakistan.
Anindita Ghosh¬†is a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Illinois Chicago. Her dissertation is about the histories of absorption of the eastern native states of South Asia into the nations and their socio- political afterlives in the post- colonial nations.
Arighna Gupta¬†is a doctoral candidate in history at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. His dissertation attempts to trace early-colonial genealogies of popular sovereignty located at the interstices of monarchical, religious, and colonial sovereignties in India and present-day Bangladesh.

Stein, ""Alternate Currents: Reiki‚Äôs Circulation in the Twentieth-Century North Pacific"" (U Hawaii Press, 2023)","In the second half of the twentieth century, Reiki went from an obscure therapy practiced by a few thousand Japanese and Japanese Americans to a global phenomenon. By the early twenty-first century, people in nearly every corner of the world have undergone the initiations that authorize them to channel a cosmic energy‚Äîknown as Reiki‚Äîto heal body, mind, and spirit. They lay hands on themselves and others, use secret symbols and incantations to send Reiki to distant recipients, and strive to follow five precepts to cultivate their spiritual growth. Reiki‚Äôs international rise and development is due to the work of Hawayo Takata (1900‚Äì1980), a Hawai‚Äòi-born Japanese American woman who brought Reiki out of Japan and adapted it for thousands of students in Hawai‚Äòi and North America, shaping interconnections across the North Pacific region as well as cultural transformations over the transwar period spanning World War II.
Alternate Currents: Reiki‚Äôs Circulation in the Twentieth-Century North Pacific¬†(U Hawaii Press, 2023) analyzes how, from her training in Japan in the mid-1930s to her death in Iowa in 1980, Takata built a vast trans-Pacific network that connected Japanese American laborers on Hawai‚Äòi plantations to social elites in Tokyo, Hollywood, and New York; middle-class housewives in American suburbs; and off-the-grid tree planters in the mountains of British Columbia. Using recently uncovered archival materials and original oral histories, this book examines how these relationships between healer and patient, master and disciple, became deeply infused with values of their time and place and how they interplayed with Reiki‚Äôs circulation, performance, and meanings along with broader cultural shifts in the twentieth-century North Pacific. Highly readable and informative, each chapter is structured around a period in the life of Takata, the charismatic, rags-to-riches architect of the network in which Reiki spread for decades.¬†
Alternate Currents¬†explores Reiki as an exemplary transnational spiritual therapy, demonstrating how lived practices transcend artificial distinctions between religion and medicine, and circulate in global systems while maintaining strong connections with the practices‚Äô homeland.

Society & Culture,International Voices,Betsy Saina,F,FALSE,22143f47e29d4969b6e80ced9fb3822c,6b7b56ee-1f41-11ef-b5dc-b76f0f16a0f5,Women's Running Stories,Race Report: Betsy Saina + 2024 USATF 25k National Championships,"Olympian and professional marathon runner for Asics Betsy Saina tells the story of how it all went down at the 2024 USATF 25k National Championships. Saina returned to this race as the reining champion.
Saina was born in Kenya and that is where she currently lives. She came to the US for college and had an incredible collegiate career racing for Iowa State University. Saina went on to become an Olympian racing for Kenya in the 10,000 meter event at the 2016 Olympics in Rio. There, she finished an incredible fifth place. Betsy has since become an American citizen and now competes for the United States.¬†
Coming into the 25k championships, Saina was on a comeback, a redemption period, which was kicked off early this year, 2024. Her record-setting performance at the 25k is one more statement in this part of her journey, demonstrating that she is back and literally better than ever.
But to appreciate the full context of Saina's recent racing, this story goes back a bit further than this year, beginning with her becoming a mom for the first time, in December of 2021.¬†
Leading into 2024, having returned to elite level racing post-pregnancy, Saina was focused on making the 2024 US Olympic Marathon team. She was a clear choice. She'd run the fastest marathon of any American woman in 2023, and she was coming into the Olympic Trials in peak fitness. But, to make the team, she still needed to place top 3 in the Olympic Trials, which were held in February 2024.
Saina succumbed to the heat at the Trials, and her Olympic marathon dreams were over. In the months following the Trials, however, Saina has been demonstrating just how fit and race ready she actually is, and this 25k champs puts an exclamation point on that journey.
In this episode, Saina tells the whole story, from her pregnancy journey, through her deeply disappointing Marathon Trials experience, up to the 25k champs, where she did indeed earn a spot in the record books. This is the terrific comeback story of a champion racer.
This episode is part of the WRS series of Race Report episodes. Just like last year, 2023, you can expect a Race Report episode for each race of the USATF Road Circuit series of races. Each episode features one top 10 runner telling the story of how the race went down, from her perspective. And because a race is never just about what happens on race day, you will get to know a little bit more about each one of the runners featured and how this race figures into their larger running story.
The USATF Running Circuit championship series of races happen throughout the United States all year long and each race serves as a national championship for the distance or the type of race that is being run. Also, at each one of these races, in addition to vying for a national title, runners earn cash prizes and they earn points. The points go toward the series overall, which is determined at the end of the year.
The next race on the circuit: the 6k National Championships which will take place in Canton, OH on July 13. Be sure to subscribe to the podcast so you don't miss the race report!
You can catch up on all the Race Reports on our website or on your favorite podcast app.

Today, we delve deep into a topic that resonates with so many women‚Äîembracing the title of ‚Äúleader.‚Äù Surprisingly, many women, even those involved in significant responsibilities like leading home groups or running households, often hesitate to claim this title.

The killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran happened only hours after Israel struck a south Beirut suburb, claiming to have killed Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr.
Mr Haniyeh was on a trip to Iran for the inauguration of president Masoud Pezeshkian when he was killed, provoking vows of punishment against Israel by the country‚Äôs supreme leader, although Israel has yet to claim the attack. The strike in Lebanon came days after a rocket hit a football field in Majdal Shams in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children, for which Israel and Hezbollah blamed each other.
In the aftermath of a deadly week, we look at what happens when two major players in the so-called ‚ÄúAxis of Resistance‚Äù are attacked and how these escalations will affect ceasefire talks in Gaza. In this episode, host Nada AlTaher speaks to MENA programme director at Crisis Group Joost Hiltermann and Palestinian analyst Taghreed El-Khodary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And, <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/derushaj/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Jason Derusha</a>, I don't know how you feel about being introduced as being obsessed with food. I probably should start with that you're a very professional broadcaster first.</p><p><a href=""https://www.instagram.com/derushaj/?hl=en"" target=""_blank"">Jason Derusha </a>[00:00:32]:</p><p>I'm pretty obsessed, though, so I think it works. I think it works.</p><p>Stephanie [00:00:36]:</p><p>Jason is the host of <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/podcast/drivetime-with-derusha-e6b7c"" target=""_blank"">Drive Time with Derusha</a> from 3 to 6 on <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/wccoradio"" target=""_blank"">WCCO Radio</a>. And you may have known him from making the leap from being a TV news anchor to a broadcaster over in the audio space. You and I are are friendly. We, see each other at things and we chat and you've been super helpful for me in my freelance journey. But I just really wanted to chat with you about, like, how's it going? Most people, I think, see the idea of being on, like, the evening news and then going to AM radio as a step back. But I thought it was super fascinating for you, and I'd just love to see how it's going.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:01:18]:</p><p>Well, thank you, and I appreciate you asking me. It is, I I had to get over my own sort of mental block as to whether or not this was a step back. And, also, like, is that even a relevant question? Like, who cares if it's a step back? Right? But, all of these things are sort of wrapped up in, oh, gosh. It just goes back to, like, when you're a kid. Right? Like, what was your vision of yourself? Is it okay to stop and say, like, I think I've achieved what I need to achieve? And that that sort of I don't know. It was an emotional decision for me because very much my identity was wrapped up in being the TV news guy.</p><p>Stephanie [00:02:03]:</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:02:04]:</p><p>And probably for my 1st year at <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/wccoradio"" target=""_blank"">WCCO Radio,</a> when I would do events, I would I would, still, like, sort of struggle with how do I introduce myself. And even stuff like talking to my my, kids about you know, as an alum of Marquette University, when I was the morning news anchor, like, there was some prestige with that. When you are the afternoon radio talk show host on AM radio, It's just a little different for a younger generation. I will say this. Releasing yourself from sort of the burden of your own self expectations is incredibly liberating. And doing something because you wanna grow and you wanna challenge yourself and you want to be sort of okay at something and then get better, oh my gosh. Like, it has been so invigorating for me. I'm so glad I did it.</p><p>Stephanie [00:03:07]:</p><p>It's such a weird thing too because I came from radio and did then go to TV.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:03:14]:</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Stephanie [00:03:14]:</p><p>And and people act like TV is like the holy grail, but yet you've been doing something for 15 years over here. And the mediums are both broadcast, but the way you interact with people is super different.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:03:28]:</p><p>Yes. Yeah. I've found you know, morning news and talk radio have a little more in common than when I was on the nighttime news. I remember when I was the Good Question reporter in the 10 o'clock news at WCCO TV. When I went to the morning show, all of a sudden, there was this much more personal intimate connection with the audience. And doing talk radio is like next level of that. Where on television, like, people got little glimpses into my life. And on radio, you know, all last week, and we're recording this in early September, but when when I was at the Minnesota State Fair, people were coming up to me wishing me good luck at dropping off my oldest at NYU because they knew this weekend I was going to New York to drop off my oldest.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:04:17]:</p><p>Like, they just have that relationship with you, which is really fun. I mean, I think I've always had, maybe more of a personal relationship with the audience and, like, the traditional, you know, stand on mount anchor desk and deliver the sermon sort of TV news anchor that's never really been me. But it's just different when you have 3 hours to talk to people. You know?</p><p>Stephanie [00:04:39]:</p><p>One thing that's really struck me as a talk radio fan, and I have been for, I don't know, my whole life really from the time that my dad made me listen to <a href=""https://www.audacy.com/wccoradio"" target=""_blank"">WCCO</a> in the 5th grade on the drive to school. I'm very impressed with how you handle this time that we're in where politics is so polarizing and people are just so feeling their feels all the time and really need to share those feelings with you. I just was noticing on, posts that you did that someone was mad that you weren't at the state fair on Labor Day and it's like, wow. People. But, also, I love the way that you you let people have their opinions, but you also don't let them abuse you, and I think there's a difference.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:05:26]:</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. It's tricky. I mean, in TV news, I spent 25 years trying to get the audience to trust me. And part of that is, especially in morning news, you wanna be liked. Not that you shy away from asking tough questions, but you wanna do it in a likable way. That's what the audience wants. And here in in the talk space, it's it's hard.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:05:56]:</p><p>It would be very easy if I were a left wing talk show host or a right wing talk show host, and then you just play the hits. You are essentially KDWB of political ideas. You play the top 40. You people know what you're gonna do, and you do it. And they like it. And people see in me what they want to see. So if they want to be mad at me and they are, Republicans and you're like you can make a line between Trump supporter I try to with Republican listeners. Like, look.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:06:37]:</p><p>I am open to many Republican ideas. I'm not open to Donald Trump. Like, sorry. He's disqualified himself for me. That is not something I talk about a lot on the show because what's the point Other than making yourself feel, you know, good, I guess. I I I always think of my show as, like, the Thanksgiving table growing up where my uncle was, my uncle was a lawyer. He went to Madison. My grandfather was a hardcore Ronald Reagan Republican.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:07:14]:</p><p>And everyone would duke it out, and everyone was welcome to join in. You're sort of expected to join in. And it was fine. Today, we've taken and I get it. Some of the issues we're talking about are very fundamental issues to different people. Right? It's it's a very white male sort of, privileged position to say, like, most of these issues for me are not life and death. But I also think it's not good for political discourse that we've turned everything into life or or death. And I don't I don't know that that what does that get us? Do we have better discussions? Do we have better participation? Do we have better policy because we've turned everything into a fundamental life and death, good or evil question? I I don't see a benefit to it.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:08:06]:</p><p>So I try not to do that on my show.</p><p>Stephanie [00:08:09]:</p><p>I have noticed a change in you from when you first started broadcasting on the station, and I thought this was interesting because as a TV newsperson, you weren't supposed to have a lot of personality. You were supposed to be fairly impartial and just like a blank slate of</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:08:27]:</p><p>Yeah. The news for you. Star. Right? The news is the star, not me.</p><p>Stephanie [00:08:32]:</p><p>And I think it took you a little while to find your rhythm of how what to push, what buttons to push, how hard to push. And I'm really, pleasantly surprised and encouraged of the progress that you've made. I think you're just doing great.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:08:48]:</p><p>It it's so nice, it's so nice of you to say that. I have had a tremendous coach at the radio station, and the thing I miss most about TV is the team. And I was more I don't know. I coworkers called me the CFO of our morning show. Mhmm. And that stood for chief feelings officer. My job was to sort of keep the trains on the track and make sure everyone felt heard and validated. And I didn't always tell people they were right, but they always were heard.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:09:24]:</p><p>And so my job was to lift everybody else up. Well, in radio, it's just it's me and a producer. That's it. And we have a a brand manager who's, like, a program director of WCCO Radio, Brad Lane. And he's been tremendous, you know, and you can talk to any of my managers over the year. I've always have good relationship with managers, but I generally don't like to be told, what to do. Typical, media Broadcaster. Broadcaster.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:09:55]:</p><p>Right? But in this case, like, I needed guidance. I needed coaching. I didn't really know how to do this. I I knew how to host, and I knew how to interview, but I didn't really know how to navigate talk radio today, which is different from talk radio 10 years ago. 10 years ago, if you could frame the issue well, people would call in. Today, people react to talk radio sort of like they do a a Facebook status update. They wanna know your take, and then they'll react.</p><p>Stephanie [00:10:24]:</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:10:25]:</p><p>Well, that took me a lot of work because, you know, do people really wanna hear my take? Is my take valid? Do I you know, it's all of those issues. And even as someone who's always had sort of an outsized personality in town, I still had that doubt of, like, do I really do I know what I'm talking about? Why are people really and he the the way Brad phrases it is he's like, what is your show about? What is your show about? And a lot of people ask me that. What is your show about? Which is such a funny question because you and I both, like, grew up listening to talk radio. So, like, I grew up in Chicago. WGN talk radio was part of my life. And then there was an FM talk radio, the loop in Chicago. That was more comedians, a little more edgy, a little younger. And you're like, talk radio is about well, fundamentally, it's about whatever the host wants to talk about.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:11:25]:</p><p>So, like, you know, your show that you do, what is your show about? Well, like, the subject matter is food, but, like, it's really about your lens, what you care about. And that seems so egotistical. You're like, oh, it's all about me? Yeah. But it kind of is. Right? That's kinda what it is. So I it took a while for me to learn that. It took honestly, I would say it took a year of doing it 5 days a week until I really got comfortable with it. And I still feel like I'm good, not great.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:12:01]:</p><p>Whereas after 25 years of TV, not being arrogant, but I think I was great. Yeah. And so it's kind of fun to not be great at something and learn it. I've enjoyed that.</p><p>Stephanie [00:12:14]:</p><p>Yeah. And I think it's revealed a lot about you as a person, that is hard to tap into and to be vulnerable and to let people see that side. Particularly, you know, we're performing these shows in a really polarizing time and in a time where people just they go after you. I mean, the amount of personal attack that hosts receive on something as benign as a food show, it's real.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:12:46]:</p><p>I'm surprised by it, to be honest. And I'm a very online person, so I shouldn't be surprised by it. But, what's happened, and certainly you get it from people listening to you, but the people who actually listen, get it for the most part. Like, there's some attack, but mostly the listeners I don't know. All during the fair, I have people coming up telling me that, like, they disagree with me politically, but they really like how I do my show, which that's the best. Yeah. But part of the challenge with the digital world and the social media world is, you know, like, I I said this to someone this morning. How much of my energy am I supposed to spend on someone who doesn't listen and never will listen? So all day, every day, both the Republicans and the Democrats run against the media right now.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:13:41]:</p><p>The media is the media where's the media? Why doesn't the media say this? Why is this the headline? Why are you framing it this way? Media, media, media, media, which is sort of interesting considering, supposedly, no one cares about the media anymore, and no one lets no one reads, no one subscribes, no one so you're like, but but it's a great boogie, man. Right? Like, if you run against the media, you don't have to confront the fact that your candidate maybe sucks. Right? Like, it's my fault. And that's been a bit of a challenge for me to figure out, like, obviously, I want to convince people to give my show a chance, but I think most of the people who are engaging in sort of a negative way, are not convincible. Right? Like, they're not so how much of my energy am I supposed to spend on that? I don't know. It's a bit of a challenge.</p><p>Stephanie [00:14:34]:</p><p>Well and I do think they listen. I think that people love to have feelings and emotions. And if they're not sure where to have them or they are in a place in their life where they're lonely or they're othered or whatever the case may be, I think sometimes people tune in just to feel something because they feel empty inside.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:14:59]:</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. And you get I don't know. Like, I always try to remember that there are and the same is true of callers or texters on radio. There are a lot more people who are listening, who are lurkers. Right? Like, that's what we would call them on Facebook or Twitter, the lurkers. So by modeling sort of reasonable, friendly, but passionate discussion, I think there's some benefit to that for the people who are observing and don't wanna jump into the mess.</p><p>Stephanie [00:15:34]:</p><p>Do you ever think about getting off Twitter? I know a lot of media personalities have.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:15:39]:</p><p>I do. I do. But, mostly, I enjoy it. Like, mostly, I get positive interaction out of it. I've started to curate it a little more. Like, I mute a lot of people that you know, if I feel someone getting my blood pressure rising, I'll just mute them. It's okay. Like, they don't need, like, block.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:15:58]:</p><p>I don't need to do that. But, like, I and people who I have a policy, if you call me or my family a name, you just get blocked. Like, there's no I don't need that. So I I do think about it. It is one of those things where you're like, the upside of something like Twitter acts. The upside is you get a lot of audience. I have, I don't know, 80,000 followers there. Certainly, most people don't see all of that stuff, and who knows how many are are relevant.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:16:33]:</p><p>But, you know, a a normal tweet of mine might get seen might get, you know, 10, 20, 30000. Like, that's pretty good.</p><p>Stephanie [00:16:42]:</p><p>It's also so immediate when you're on the air. Like Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:16:45]:</p><p>You need. For show, it's amazing. Like, what I I never think about leaving. I think about and I have adjusted what I will post about, just because it's not really fruitful for the most part. And you think, like, is my voice needed on this topic? Not really. Like, so do I need to weigh in on a lot of political type things? Not really. So I I've sort of, cut down on that. But you're right.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:17:15]:</p><p>Like, from a listening standpoint, from a breaking news standpoint, it's amazing. It's unparalleled, frankly.</p><p>Stephanie [00:17:22]:</p><p>Yeah. I would agree with that. You took a weight loss journey, and I think you lost ¬£40 last I checked.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:17:29]:</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Stephanie [00:17:30]:</p><p>And you've always been someone in the food space. Did that feel conflicting for you to do the weight loss route and at the same time be championing and talking about all the food?</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:17:44]:</p><p>Yeah. I mean, people ask me all the time. They're like, how do you eat this much? I'm like, well, I'm, you know, I'm sharing. I'm taking bites or whatever. I do think about it. Right? I think the reason that I lost weight was so I could live, not so I could hide. And so I don't really feel conflicted about that. The truth is, though, could I have lost that weight by eating out 4 nights a week? Probably not.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:18:13]:</p><p>Yeah. So it is a challenge of eating out. I certainly am a little more careful now in how I order. And the way we used to, you know, some of this, like, COVID has changed it, but a normal night for us back in the pre COVID days would be you go somewhere for drinks, go somewhere else for appetizers, go somewhere else for a main course, and go somewhere else for dessert and drinks. And thinking about that while I was on the weight loss journey, like, I was probably eating 4000 3 or 4000 calories a night just in that. Like, not lunch, not breakfast. And so that's not sustainable. But can I do that occasionally? Sure.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:18:53]:</p><p>Yeah. Why not? So I I the biggest thing I was conflicted about is the weight loss journey that I took. You know, I've always been, like, sort of an organic whole foods farm to table type eater. But to lose weight, quickly and sustainably, it's difficult to do it on whole food. It just takes a lot longer. Now I was eating whole foods. It wasn't like a liquid diet or anything. But, like, it is success breeds success.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:19:21]:</p><p>And when you start when you lose that ¬£10 in 2 weeks, you're like, oh, I can do this and then do it. Like, for me, I needed that. Other people, you know, maybe you can lose ¬£40 in 2 years and do it by eating more salads and be more careful. But, like, getting the protein you need and the nutrients and all of that, it's it's just difficult if you go on a severe calorie restriction diet. It's difficult.</p><p>Stephanie [00:19:45]:</p><p>It's interesting too. I think for what we're seeing in the media now, like, everyone not everyone, but a lot of people are on the weight loss drugs and taking the shots. Many people are talking about it, many people aren't. Some are talking privately. And as someone who's a bigger person, like I'm not obese, but I'm a size 12 or 14 usually. I think about like, can I manage my weight with a magic, like, pill and No? Do that? Like, that feels like it could be amazing. And then they're also finding that with the reduced inflammation, people are happier or less depressed Yeah. Or sex.</p><p>Stephanie [00:20:27]:</p><p>It's like, oh my gosh. Is this the miracle drug? But then at the same time, as people who champion the food space, can you make food the the devil in that situation and still talk about it? It's it's something I both my radio partner and I have talked about a lot.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:20:46]:</p><p>It's tricky. Right? Like, I am cheering for small business. I'm cheering for creativity, for innovation. So I'm cheering for that. Food is and I love food. We love, eating out. We love the experience of it. But food is really I mean, food is the vessel for all this other stuff.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:21:13]:</p><p>Right? So is it do I love, love, love the particular dish, or do I love the experience? So I think, like, you know, you and your radio partner, Stephanie and I, I think the 3 of us have sort of a similar approach as to what makes restaurants, fun and what makes eating out fun. And it's really it's more the social experience, the room, the way you feel, the people you're with. Like, yes, good food, technique, all of that matters, but the other stuff matters more. And so when I was losing weight, my wife and I, you know, we had to sort of radically reenvision what we're gonna do for fun. So because we knew, like, you know, what would we do on a Saturday if we had a day free? Like, go to a maybe go to a a tap room or maybe go to a bar. It's like we can't do that. So we're like, alright. Let's go for a hike or, you know, you're trying some different stuff.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:22:17]:</p><p>It's interesting as you age too. Right? Like, it's I can't eat the way I did 10 years ago.</p><p>Stephanie [00:22:23]:</p><p>And, also, like, I became recently aware, which why it took so long, I don't know, of, like, that what I view as fun is always food related. It's always my go to thing, and I</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:22:36]:</p><p>don't Yeah.</p><p>Stephanie [00:22:37]:</p><p>I don't think about, like, oh, let's go have a bike ride. I think about let's go have a bike ride to this brewery or this orchard or it's like the destination, not the journey.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:22:47]:</p><p>We're trying to, like you know, we went to a a show at the Guthrie a couple weeks ago. It's like, oh, and we loved it. And it's like, okay. Let's, like, let's remember to kind of, you know, Yeah. Sprinkle the other stuff into.</p><p>Stephanie [00:23:03]:</p><p>I want to, just thank you for some of the folks you've had on Derusha Eats. I was, thinking about Manny from Manny's,</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:23:11]:</p><p>Tortoise. Yeah.</p><p>Stephanie [00:23:13]:</p><p>25 years, Manny Gonzalez has been over there doing the work, and I was just really taken aback when he said he'd never been on the radio in 25 years. And I thought, well, good for you for having him on, and, wow, why did it take us so long? You just there's so many great voices out there and so much more to our food scene than the typical, you know, James Beard award winning chef. Right?</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:23:38]:</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. It that was a lesson I learned in my TV years of doing stories on restaurants. The audience resonated with, like, the neighborhood pizza place a lot more than the James Beard award type place. And, like, I don't know. I think about that often. Right? Like, people get more jazzed about mama's pizza in Saint Paul or Latah Latifs in</p><p>Stephanie [00:24:06]:</p><p>Plymouth. Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:24:07]:</p><p>Where they've got, like, the diamond it's sort of the diamond shaped cut. You know, people resonate with that more, and that makes sense. Right? Like, it's the reason The Cheesecake Factory back in the day was, like, the biggest restaurant opening of that year. Yeah. Because, people don't like feeling dumb. They don't like looking at menus where they don't know what the ingredients are, or they don't know how to say it. And neighborhood pizza places are awesome. Right? Like, they support the softball teams, and they support the youth, soccer teams.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:24:44]:</p><p>And so I've always tried to give those guys a voice. It is it is a balance of, like, how do you keep it? So what really helps me is my producer, Dan Cook, does not care about restaurants at all. He doesn't care. He is mister meat and potatoes. He doesn't know anything that I'm talking about. And so when I do an interview where he's like, oh, that was really interesting. Like, he loved the Manny Gonzalez in the interview. And you're like, okay.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:25:13]:</p><p>That's really what I'm trying to do. So I I do think about that a lot. Like, I definitely light up with the classics more. So, like, the Bilkoslag from Jack's</p><p>Stephanie [00:25:26]:</p><p>Game Fair. That was a great interview too.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:25:28]:</p><p>Like, the though those ones, always sorta get me going. So it's something that I think about. Like, this month, we're gonna have, Murray's, Tim Murray, and we're gonna have JD Hoyt's. But we're also gonna have a case, Johnson who just, has this, you know, chicken tenders type Yep. Restaurant. So, like, I try to think, you know, can we have more women on? Can we have more people of color on? Do we have the classics who don't get the love on? Like, I'm always trying to think of that stuff.</p><p>Stephanie [00:26:08]:</p><p>You do</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:26:08]:</p><p>have the new new the new new new, I always get nervous about on broadcast. Because if you're reading my stuff in Minnesota Monthly, you opt in. If you're going to a new place, you know. Like, Jason may love it, and you may go on another day, and it might be a train wreck. And that's sort of buyer beware. If you go to a place in the 1st 2 or 3 months, that's gonna happen.</p><p>Stephanie [00:26:32]:</p><p>Do you feel like a food reviewer? I mean, that's your title technically in Minnesota Monthly, but I feel like you carved out this other seat for yourself.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:26:41]:</p><p>Yeah. I always feel a little awkward considering myself a critic. I mean, it it's the easiest way for people to understand it, but I'm not doing as much reviewing anymore. And part of the problem with reviewing versus recommending is that to really critically review a place, you need to go 3 times.</p><p>Stephanie [00:27:05]:</p><p>Absolutely.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:27:06]:</p><p>You just do. It's not fair to roast somebody. And I can write a review and do the old, you know, crap sandwich with, like, this was good. This was good. Oh, this needs a little work. This was good. And I feel okay doing that on one visit, But, you know, mostly people wanna know where to go and what to order. And so, because I don't have the budget to really adequately review, you gotta do what you can do.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:27:38]:</p><p>So,</p><p>Stephanie [00:27:38]:</p><p>like, I company is gonna send you 10 times like they used to send Ruth Reichl at the New York Times.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:27:44]:</p><p>So I just try to carve out my area. I think people know that I'm honest. I'm not gonna deceive them. I'm not gonna puff up a place that's not good. But if I never talk about a place, you probably know why.</p><p>Stephanie [00:27:58]:</p><p>Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:27:58]:</p><p>Like, I don't like it.</p><p>Stephanie [00:28:00]:</p><p>Yeah. And it doesn't help sometimes, I think, either to pounce on a place once everyone's identified that it's not great.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:28:07]:</p><p>No. And there is I I think there is a space for, like, informed recommendation. Right? We have, like, the TikTok, Instagram world of, like, this is open. Whoo. Like, you have that. And that has its usefulness too. Like, people like to chase that. That's fun.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:28:23]:</p><p>But I try to be like, alright. I'm gonna I'm gonna give you an informed recommendation. It's not quite a review. I don't know. I I I try I try. It's a it's a tricky thing. Right? Like, what does the audience want? Do people people always say they want critical reviews, but, like, just not about their favorite place. Yeah.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:28:46]:</p><p>Exactly. People really want critical reviews. I I don't know.</p><p>Stephanie [00:28:51]:</p><p>I don't know. What's next for you? You've launched your substack. I've got 10 minutes left. And in that 10 minutes, I wanna know what's next and also the most embarrassing thing in your refrigerator.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:29:07]:</p><p>So what's next? For for me, I am hoping to launch, like, a more unified brand. I have, like, all of these different things under my umbrella, and none of it looks the same. None of it has the same logo. Not you're like, what are we doing here? So I I like to unify things a little bit. You know, the Substack, you sort of inspired me to switch over to Substack from doing, like, a Mailchimp email I was doing. I've loved that outlet. So that's been really fun. You know, trying to figure out, like, Minnesota Monthly pays me to write.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:29:47]:</p><p>Like, I gotta write for them. Like, I'm not saving it all for the newsletter. Like Yep. How do you make that work is something that I'm sort of working on. But I would like the other thing that I would like to launch, and I do release my restaurant interviews in podcast form. And over the next year, I I sort of wanna figure out, like, what is the right way to do that. Should I be you know, I experimented. I did an interview with Sameh Wadi where we taped it ahead of time instead of doing it live on the radio.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:30:18]:</p><p>And so I spent 45 minutes with him asking questions, and so it was a longer podcast, and I think people like that. So trying to figure out, like, how do I do the radio? You know, I'm doing 3 hours of radio a day, so it doesn't leave as much free time as, you know, my family jokes that I work 3 hours, but you're like, well</p><p>Stephanie [00:30:38]:</p><p>An hour and a half of prep for every hour on the radio.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:30:41]:</p><p>It takes a little bit of reading and planning and all of that. So that's you know, I I the the concrete plan is relaunch jason to russia.com. There's that website was built, like, 8 years ago. I'd like to freshen that up. So brand refresh, website refresh, those are the big plans for the next year. Try not to get fired during this political stretch. Don't get canceled. All of</p><p>Stephanie [00:31:10]:</p><p>those things. What's embarrassing that's in your fridge?</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:31:13]:</p><p>Oh, what is embarrassing that's in my fridge? There's currently a bottle of Kirkland, sparkling rose in my fridge.</p><p>Stephanie [00:31:23]:</p><p>But it is kinda good.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:31:25]:</p><p>It's kinda good. I, you know, I mean, that's a little embarrassing.</p><p>Stephanie [00:31:30]:</p><p>That's funny.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:31:31]:</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. That's probably that's probably the most embarrassing thing in there right now.</p><p>Stephanie [00:31:37]:</p><p>You know what else is kinda interesting about you? And I work for freelance myself. Mhmm. So I'm 1099 everywhere I work. And I see myself as my own company, my own brand. I also see you as seeing yourself like that, and that's interesting to me and a shift for you.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:31:56]:</p><p>Yeah. At some point, that might be where it goes. I will say, like, as someone sort of new to the side hustle world, it's exhausting.</p><p>Stephanie [00:32:07]:</p><p>Yeah. It's really hard.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:32:08]:</p><p>Like, you're pitching yourself all the time.</p><p>Stephanie [00:32:11]:</p><p>It's very hard.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:32:13]:</p><p>And, you know, trying there's something to be said for, like, every 2 weeks. Like, the check comes. Yeah. The regular job. It's kinda nice. So when you're, you know, when you're pitching yourself a lot for a $1,000 here or for a trade out, like, oh,</p><p>Stephanie [00:32:36]:</p><p>okay. Free meal.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:32:39]:</p><p>Yeah. You you know, I don't do a ton of that, but, like, it it does get exhausting. And then you have different you have different clients who have different needs. So, like, you know, one of the things I'm struggling with right now is there's a there's a restaurant owner who owns, I don't know, 5 or 6 different local restaurants. I love these restaurants. So he asked me about, like, doing influencing for him, doing a little digital campaign. And the trick is, like, at what point, like, if I'm getting if I'm getting paid, like, how many restaurants is that okay for? Like, do people start doubting my reviews? Does that or my recommendations? Like, how do you keep integrity in what you're doing, but also, like, keep the lights on so you can</p><p>Stephanie [00:33:30]:</p><p>do it? It's a it's a line, and I don't have the answer because I've struggled with it myself. All I can say is if you are approaching it with integrity, but I don't know. When someone sells an endorsement for you on the radio station, they're making $80 and, you know, you're making $5,000. Right. So</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:33:52]:</p><p>Right.</p><p>Stephanie [00:33:52]:</p><p>I I did an endorsement for ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ertix, which I know you've done. And people still I mean, people will associate me with Certix till the end of time.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:34:01]:</p><p>Yeah. Yeah. And it's</p><p>Stephanie [00:34:03]:</p><p>great because I love the family and I that's why I did the project that I did because I really enjoy them as people and stewards of northeast. But, yeah, it does close doors, and, you know, was it worth it? I don't know.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:34:16]:</p><p>Right. Yeah. It's a little tricky just trying to figure that out. And, like, if I were not writing for Minnesota Monthly, then I wouldn't even worry about it.</p><p>Stephanie [00:34:27]:</p><p>Yeah. It would be different for sure.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:34:28]:</p><p>But, like, in the Minnesota Monthly thing is, opens a lot of doors for me. Right? When you say you're the food writer, I mean, how many food writers are there for regional magazines across the country? 15? 10? I know. There are not that many. So, like, so that's sort of a job where it's like it pays for itself. Like, who cares that I don't get paid that much for it? It opens so many doors. So but then if you're not gonna cash in on those doors opening, what are you doing? So, like, trying to figure it all of that stuff is I spend a lot of time thinking about that.</p><p>Stephanie [00:35:06]:</p><p>Me too.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:35:07]:</p><p>Yeah. Just trying to keep integrity and also, like, make things worth your time.</p><p>Stephanie [00:35:14]:</p><p>And with that, as my free Zoom subscription is winding down</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:35:19]:</p><p>That's right. That's all that's all we're doing. How many free like, I edit my video on a free video editing? Yes, sir. We</p><p>Stephanie [00:35:28]:</p><p>have 3 minutes left to wrap it up.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:35:32]:</p><p>That's right. I invoice using Google Sheets.</p><p>Stephanie [00:35:35]:</p><p>Yep. No. I I know.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:35:36]:</p><p>My accounting is like my emails and try you know, it's all a train wreck.</p><p>Stephanie [00:35:41]:</p><p>Yes. It is. But it's been super fun to spend time with you and just to I wanted to just tell you you're doing a good job and Thank you. Tell you I've noticed that there's growth happening and that I think what you did took a lot of courage, and I've been a a fan. And I it's</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:35:58]:</p><p>fun listening. That means a lot, especially coming from you because I just respect kind of the way you have conducted your business and figured all of this out. And, I think both of us sort of follow what we think is fun and then hope the business type things sort of follow. Yeah. It's worked out okay, I think, for both of us.</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:19]:</p><p>So far so good.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:36:20]:</p><p>We'll knock</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:21]:</p><p>on some wood that we're not both fired in</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:36:23]:</p><p>the middle of the day. That's right.</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:25]:</p><p>Alright. Thanks, Caitlin.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:36:27]:</p><p>Thanks, Stephanie.</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:28]:</p><p>Okay. Where do you want people to follow you?</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:36:32]:</p><p>Instagram is good. Instagram or Facebook is probably the best way. Right? Like, they can get my my radio show podcast is everywhere, so we upload every segment and all of that. So those are probably the best.</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:46]:</p><p>Alright. Well, thanks for being on, and I really appreciate your time.</p><p>Jason Derusha [00:36:49]:</p><p>Thanks, Steph.</p><p>Stephanie [00:36:50]:</p><p>Okay.

An award-winning veterinarian, she started City Pets Vets, an exclusively house-call veterinary practice, over three decades ago. Since then, she's worked with over 7,000 Manhattan families and cared for more than 14,000 of their dogs and cats in the comfort of their own homes.¬†Some of her stories are about A list stars, like the time she saw a famous singer naked (no, her rash was not the same as her puppy's). Others are about remarkable animals, like the skilled service dog who, after his exam was finished, left the room and returned with a checkbook in his mouth. Every tale in this rollicking, informative, and fun memoir affirms a key truth about animal, and human, nature: Our pets love us because their hearts are pure; we love them because they're freaking adorable. On some level, we know that by caring for them, we are the best version of ourselves. In short: Our pets make us better people.¬†When a pet is sick, people-even the rich and famous-are at their most authentic and vulnerable. They could have a Monet on the wall and an Oscar on the shelf, but if their cat gets a cold, all they want to talk about are snotty noses and sneezing fits.¬†For over 30 years Dr. Amy Attas has been a personal vet to the rich and famous, including:¬†.¬†<b>Joan Rivers</b>, who brought her sick dog to Dr. Amy's hospital in full glam and tipped a nurse $50, ""It's my insurance policy. This way, I know you won't beat my dog."" Rivers went on to tell all her friends about Amy's new house-call practice.¬†.¬†<b>Billy Joel</b>: regular client and friend, sent his pugs to Dr. Amy by limo or helicopter from Long Island.¬†.¬†<b>Paul McCartney</b>, who adopted a rescue dog at Dr. Amy's recommendation.¬†.¬†<b>Steve Martin</b>¬†- Dr. Amy treated his dog Roger, in his trailer on the set of the Pink Panther.

The enigmatic and elusive filmmaker Stanley Kubrick has not been treated to a full-length biography in over twenty years.
Kubrick: An Odyssey¬†(Pegasus Books, 2024) fills that gap. This definitive book is based on access to the latest research, especially Kubrick's archive at the University of the Arts, London, as well as other private papers plus new interviews with family members and those who worked with him. It offers comprehensive and in-depth coverage of Kubrick‚Äôs personal, private, public, and working life.¬†Stanley Kubrick: An Odyssey¬†investigates not only the making of Kubrick's films, but also about those he wanted (but failed) to make like¬†Burning Secret, Napoleon, Aryan Papers, and¬†A.I.
This immersive biography will puncture the controversial myths about the reclusive filmmaker who created some of the most important works of art of the twentieth century.

After a few years making a living out west playing at ski lodges, she moved to Nashville, where she carved out a special place in 1990s country music. Amid a time of diversity and vibrancy in the format, her sweet, folky voice took flight when she found the right songs, including the career-makers ‚ÄúSomeday Soon‚Äù and ‚ÄúOutbound Plane.‚Äù She‚Äôs toured steadily ever since, though recordings have been selective since 2000. During the pandemic though, she took on her first album of new material with last fall‚Äôs <em>Prayin‚Äô For Sunshine</em>, the first where she‚Äôd written all of the songs. In this hour, we cover every key stage of this award-winning career.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This declaration, penned by Dr. Sunita Gupta of Oxford, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya of Stanford, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard, proposes a pandemic response strategy centered on achieving herd immunity through natural infection, particularly among younger, healthier populations.</p> <h3>The Underestimation of COVID-19</h3> <p>At the heart of the episode is a critical examination of how the declaration's authors may have underestimated the severity of COVID-19. The hosts reflect on early pandemic opinions, including those from John Ioannidis and Dr. Scott Atlas, that influenced the declaration. They discuss the implications of pursuing herd immunity without a vaccine and the potential risks to public health, especially considering the virus's impact on different age groups.</p> <h3>Ethical Concerns and Scientific Debate</h3> <p>A significant part of the discussion focuses on the ethical dilemmas posed by the declaration. The idea of intentionally allowing a segment of the population to be infected raises serious moral questions. The hosts challenge the notion that young people have an obligation to contract the virus, likening it to a ""war"" against COVID-19.</p> <h3>The Role of Dr. Scott Atlas</h3> <p>Dr. Scott Atlas, a prominent figure in the Trump administration's COVID-19 response, is also discussed. His support for natural infection as a pathway to herd immunity is critically examined, with the hosts highlighting his statements from various interviews and articles.</p> <h3>The Impact of Herd Immunity Without Vaccination</h3> <p>The episode does not shy away from discussing the historical context of herd immunity and its effectiveness in managing pandemics. The hosts argue that without vaccination, achieving lasting herd immunity may be an unattainable goal, citing examples from the history of diseases like measles and smallpox.</p> <h3>Final Words</h3> <p>In conclusion, the episode provides a comprehensive critique of the Great Barrington Declaration, emphasizing the need for a nuanced, ethical, and scientifically sound approach to pandemic management. The discussion underscores the complexities of public health decision-making in times of crisis and the importance of basing strategies on robust scientific evidence and ethical considerations.</p> <p>¬†</p> <p><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong id=""docs-internal-guid-aa196cf8-7fff-29e2-a51e-ff2c31009e6b"">Resources mentioned</strong></span></p> <p dir=""ltr"">The Great Barrington Declaration</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Interviews and articles by Dr. Sunita Gupta, Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, and Dr. Martin Kulldorff</p> <p dir=""ltr"">John Ioannidis's Stat News article from March 17, 2020</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Dr. Bhattacharya's Wall Street Journal article, ""Is the Coronavirus as Deadly as They Say?""</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Dr. Martin Kulldorff's article, ""COVID-19 countermeasures should be age specific""</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Dr. Scott Atlas's article, ""Reentry After the Panic""</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Tucker Carlson's Fox News interview with Dr. Scott Atlas</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Twitter account @hypoautomatic</p> <p dir=""ltr"">Various scientific studies and data on COVID-19 mortality and transmission rates</p> <p dir=""ltr"">¬†</p> <p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>Connect with us further on <a href=""https://www.jonathanhowardmd.com/"">jonathanhowardmd.com</a>¬†</strong></span></p> <p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong><br /> <br /></strong></span></p> <p dir=""ltr""><span style=""font-size: 14pt;""><strong>The Fine Print</strong></span></p> <p dir=""ltr"">The content presented in the ""We Want Them Infected"" Podcast and associated book is intended for informational and educational purposes only.¬†</p> <p dir=""ltr""><strong>¬†</strong></p> <p dir=""ltr"">The views and opinions expressed by the speakers, hosts, and guests on the podcast do not necessarily reflect the views of the creators, producers, or distributors.

Inspired by a wildlife biologist friend of his father's, Chamberlain pursued his passion for wildlife biology at Virginia Tech, specializing in fisheries and wildlife science. In graduate school, Chamberlain's research focused on wild turkeys in the Mississippi Delta, where he combined his love of hunting with academic study. This hands-on experience, involving capturing turkeys, attaching radio transmitters, and tracking their movements, cemented his career in turkey research.<br /> ‚Å£<br /> Chamberlain has uncovered intricate social behaviors in wild turkeys, noting their tendency to be social for most of the year but solitary during reproduction. His studies reveal turkeys' complex social structures and hierarchies, similar to humans, and their regional subspecies variations. He highlights the historical domestication of turkeys, leading to today's large, non-flying commercial breeds, and contrasts their leaner, wilder counterparts.<br /> ‚Å£<br /> An advocate for sustainable hunting, Chamberlain shares tips and emphasizes the importance of mentorship for aspiring hunters. His extensive research addresses concerns about declining turkey populations, particularly in the southeast and midwest.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Managing and balancing work and family isn‚Äôt something they teach in school.¬†
Guest Kimberly ‚ÄúKim‚Äù Maney is a busy, successful in-house corporate attorney for a global corporation. She‚Äôs also a mom and a spouse who taught herself how to balance 10-hour days and constant demands from her job while carving out time for family. Raising a family is hard work, everything from coordinating childcare to spending meaningful time with children. And then, later, as kids grow up, there are soccer games, ballet recitals, and vacations.
¬†In today‚Äôs world of connectivity, it can be too easy to just ‚Äútake a call‚Äù during the family trip to Disney World. You‚Äôll need to develop and communicate boundaries with your coworkers and your organization.¬†
Maney shares how she leaned on coworkers who were already parents¬†and even Facebook parent support groups¬†as she learned to create space for family while excelling at her job.

As technology‚Äôs role on the world stage continues its decades-long exponential growth, so does the importance of how it affects each industry. For companies that fit under the definition of startup, leaders face an overwhelming number of possibilities, especially in the world of mergers and acquisitions. Companies like Corum Group Inc. use this as their bread and butter and have spent nearly 40 years as one of the world‚Äôs top M&amp;A software firms. To this day, they‚Äôve created over¬†$20 billion¬†in wealth with an impressive record of over 500 closed transactions. For top team members like Lynam, the chase for acquiring the best startups never ends, especially as the number of software companies only grows with the software world.
Lynam discusses the importance of an exit strategy, some companies he‚Äôs helped Corum Group acquire over the years, what it means to be a quality leader for a startup, and helps explain the M&amp;A process for software companies.

Sometimes we can get so caught in the weeds of the day-to-day news cycle, that we forget to see the forest for the trees. So, in the first half, I discuss a concert, the government seeming to always have good intentions, the Cobra effect and the homeless problem in California.</p> <p>We then dive into the news stack and I have more about the P. Diddy case. We also discuss a ‚Äúcare package‚Äù that the 2nd would-be assassin left with ‚Äúsome citizen.‚Äù In that package was a letter suggesting that if you are reading it, he must have failed and then encourages you to try and if successful, will be eligible for a $150,000 payment. I have some ‚Äúconspiratorial‚Äù thoughts on this I share as well.</p> <p>Congressman Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) dropped a huge news item on Friday. We now have actual transcripts from January 6 showing Trump did call for troops to be on-hand and the Pentagon was a huge part in stalling their deployment.</p> <p>Joe Biden became very confused as to what he was doing behind the lectern. Maybe that‚Äôs why he let Jill Biden run his recent cabinet meeting. It‚Äôs sad to see them treating our Republic this way. It‚Äôs sadder still to see how many people seem okay with it.</p> <p>We do get into a specific example of how Donald Trump answers the same question given to Harris. When asked how he is going to reduce prices, he gives three specific examples. When she answers, we learn nothing. However we should feel good that the people around P. Diddy support her, the IRS supports here and apparently 10 of the people who lied about the Hunter Biden laptop also support her. She really keeps great company.</p> <p>Finally, Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) actually said something honest in a rally over the weekend. He told us we cannot live through another four years like we have. He‚Äôs correct. We cannot.</p> <p>Take a moment to rate and review the show and then share the episode on social media.

They are 2 reporters on the team of journalists that just won The Collier Prize, a prestigious award given by The Collier Companies and The University of Florida for investigative journalism and political reporting specific to state governments.

The award was given for coverage on reporting on the actions and lack of actions by law enforcement that were responding to a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas that resulted in 21 deaths.

This team of journalists encompasses reporters from Pro Publica, The Texas Tribune, and PBS‚Äô documentary series, Frontline. Lomi and Lexi are 2 of many who worked on this. They work jointly for ProPublica and the Tribune.

The stories we talk about are

‚ÄúSomeone Tell Me What To Do,‚Äù which describes the police response to the shooting in-depth.

‚ÄúReports Analyzing the Police Response To A Mass Shooting Can Leave Unanswered Questions ‚Äì If They‚Äôre Released At All‚Äù

https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/police-reponse-mass-shooting-reports-questions/

Lomi and Lexi talked about the 2.5 years of work that has gone into their reporting, explaining both their findings and the challenges they faced in their reporting.

They described the collaborative effort, the databases they created, the records requests they filed, and the police interviews and body camera footage they obtained and watched. And they shared the empathy needed to cover a story of this magnitude.

They jointly salute: The entire staff of the Uvalde Leader-News

The killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran happened only hours after Israel struck a south Beirut suburb, claiming to have killed Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr.
Mr Haniyeh was on a trip to Iran for the inauguration of president Masoud Pezeshkian when he was killed, provoking vows of punishment against Israel by the country‚Äôs supreme leader, although Israel has yet to claim the attack. The strike in Lebanon came days after a rocket hit a football field in Majdal Shams in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children, for which Israel and Hezbollah blamed each other.
In the aftermath of a deadly week, we look at what happens when two major players in the so-called ‚ÄúAxis of Resistance‚Äù are attacked and how these escalations will affect ceasefire talks in Gaza. In this episode, host Nada AlTaher speaks to MENA programme director at Crisis Group Joost Hiltermann and Palestinian analyst Taghreed El-Khodary.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodman on how the world ran out of everything,"When the covid pandemic hit in March 2020, stores ran out of toilet paper. Then it was infant formula, personal protective equipment, computer chips and everything else on which our modern lives depend.What caused these worldwide shortages? In his new book, ‚ÄúHow the World Ran Out of Everything,‚Äù New York Times global economics correspondent Peter S. Goodman explains how and why the global supply chain broke ‚Äì and why it might happen again. In it, he says that inequality and corporate greed have left the world with a supply chain on the brink of collapse.‚ÄúMost of us understood that the businesses that dominated the supply chain were making the economy more unequal, enriching executives who frequently abused the rank and file, poisoning our democracies and sowing toxicity in our political discourse, to say nothing of the natural environment,‚Äù Goodman writes. ‚ÄúTo the extent to which we thought about it, we generally recognized that our mode of consumerism was threatening humanity with extinction via climate change, while exploiting labor from South Asia to Latin America.‚ÄùGoodman has reported from more than 40 countries over the past three decades. He came to the Times from the Washington Post, where he was the Shanghai bureau chief. His work as part of the Times‚Äô series on the roots of the 2008 financial crisis was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His other books include, ‚ÄúDavos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World.‚ÄùGoodman said that when people conclude ""that the powers that be don't value them, don't prioritize their needs and the needs of their families, and at the same time you have trade animosities and then migration ...that is a very toxic prescription. That creates opportunities for parties that tend to demonize outsiders, immigrants, or in our case, Chinese workers supposedly stealing our jobs. And that doesn't go well.""""Much of the West is engaged in a kind of process of looking for scapegoats, as opposed to looking at how we have allowed billionaire interests to dominate our politics and deliver scarcity,‚Äù Goodman said. ‚ÄúI think that's a very concerning combination.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As technology‚Äôs role on the world stage continues its decades-long exponential growth, so does the importance of how it affects each industry. For companies that fit under the definition of startup, leaders face an overwhelming number of possibilities, especially in the world of mergers and acquisitions. Companies like Corum Group Inc. use this as their bread and butter and have spent nearly 40 years as one of the world‚Äôs top M&amp;A software firms. To this day, they‚Äôve created over¬†$20 billion¬†in wealth with an impressive record of over 500 closed transactions. For top team members like Lynam, the chase for acquiring the best startups never ends, especially as the number of software companies only grows with the software world.
Lynam discusses the importance of an exit strategy, some companies he‚Äôs helped Corum Group acquire over the years, what it means to be a quality leader for a startup, and helps explain the M&amp;A process for software companies.

Both are scary prospects, but the ladies from Moms for Liberty really believe it is the former. They join us on the podcast this week to discuss what they are doing to fight back.
COVID was a tragic time for our country but in numerous ways it opened the eyes of countless Americans to how bad things had gotten, particularly in public schools. Conservatives, by and large, just want to work, raise their families, and be left alone. But as the saying goes, ""You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you"".
Emily Jones and Rebecca Watson sensed this war, each in their own way, and responded by starting local Alabama chapters of Moms for Liberty to educate, unify, and empower parents to protect their parental rights at all levels of government. We hear the story of how this all came about and dive into Title IX, unlicensed therapy sessions, and more.
OVERTIME SEGMENT: The Children Can't Read, Let's Lower the Standard Everyone knows the odds of children succeeding in life greatly suffers if they can't read by 3rd grade.¬†
Well, Alabama has found a solution... Apparently, they are lowering the standards so it looks like more kids are reading by the end of 3rd grade when really they‚Äôre not.

The killing of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran happened only hours after Israel struck a south Beirut suburb, claiming to have killed Hezbollah commander Fouad Shukr.
Mr Haniyeh was on a trip to Iran for the inauguration of president Masoud Pezeshkian when he was killed, provoking vows of punishment against Israel by the country‚Äôs supreme leader, although Israel has yet to claim the attack. The strike in Lebanon came days after a rocket hit a football field in Majdal Shams in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights, killing 12 children, for which Israel and Hezbollah blamed each other.
In the aftermath of a deadly week, we look at what happens when two major players in the so-called ‚ÄúAxis of Resistance‚Äù are attacked and how these escalations will affect ceasefire talks in Gaza.

Jason was tapped by the band to break the story.he can discuss the below items in addition to the book:: - Linkin Park is back, with a new album, new tour dates, new co-vocalist, and new collective outlook. Seven years after the passing of singer Chester Bennington, the band returned in September 2024 with new members Emily Armstrong and Colin Brittain, arena tour dates, as well as a new studio album,¬†<i>From Zero</i>, due out in November.¬†- The unexpected announcement resulted in a wave of chatter - as well as some outcry about Emily, the lead singer of Dead Sara, joining the band amidst question marks about her past. Nevertheless, the immediate streaming boom for new single ""The Emptiness Machine"" and ticket demand for their first shows indicate a highly anticipated comeback.¬†¬†Linkin Park is one of the 21st century's most important rock bands. All it takes is one quick glance at the numbers-11 Top 40 hits on the Hot 100 and six No. 1 albums on the Billboard 200, over a dozen massive tours, 27 major award wins, more than 100 million records sold worldwide, over 30 million monthly Spotify listeners-to realize that when it comes to the metrics of music consumption and fandom, there's no bigger group in recent memory. And yet, despite their enduring legacy within rock, there has never been a full, comprehensive biography of Linkin Park-until now. In¬†<i>IT STARTS WITH ONE: The Legend and Legacy of Linkin Park</i>, Billboard's executive director of music, Jason Lipshutz, chronicles the innovation and influence of this legendary band, from their early childhoods to the moment their paths crossed to the genesis of their iconic first album,¬†<i>Hybrid Theory</i>, to everything that followed. Not only were they able to synthesize trends in pop and hip-hop amidst the post-grunge era and nu metal boom, then constantly reinvent their sound over multiple albums, Linkin Park's radically vulnerable lyrics also helped usher in a new era of artists (and fans) more open to discussing mental health and prioritizing inclusivity. Led by front men Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda, who balanced each other out artistically, Linkin Park never shied away from songs that put their issues front and center for the world to see and feel.<br /><br />Become a supporter of this podcast: <a href=""https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/arroe-collins-like-it-s-live--4113802/support?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss"">https://www.spreaker.com/podcast/arroe-collins-like-it-s-live--4113802/support</a>.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Goodman on how the world ran out of everything,"When the covid pandemic hit in March 2020, stores ran out of toilet paper. Then it was infant formula, personal protective equipment, computer chips and everything else on which our modern lives depend.What caused these worldwide shortages? In his new book, ‚ÄúHow the World Ran Out of Everything,‚Äù New York Times global economics correspondent Peter S. Goodman explains how and why the global supply chain broke ‚Äì and why it might happen again. In it, he says that inequality and corporate greed have left the world with a supply chain on the brink of collapse.‚ÄúMost of us understood that the businesses that dominated the supply chain were making the economy more unequal, enriching executives who frequently abused the rank and file, poisoning our democracies and sowing toxicity in our political discourse, to say nothing of the natural environment,‚Äù Goodman writes. ‚ÄúTo the extent to which we thought about it, we generally recognized that our mode of consumerism was threatening humanity with extinction via climate change, while exploiting labor from South Asia to Latin America.‚ÄùGoodman has reported from more than 40 countries over the past three decades. He came to the Times from the Washington Post, where he was the Shanghai bureau chief. His work as part of the Times‚Äô series on the roots of the 2008 financial crisis was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His other books include, ‚ÄúDavos Man: How the Billionaires Devoured the World.‚ÄùGoodman said that when people conclude ""that the powers that be don't value them, don't prioritize their needs and the needs of their families, and at the same time you have trade animosities and then migration ...that is a very toxic prescription. That creates opportunities for parties that tend to demonize outsiders, immigrants, or in our case, Chinese workers supposedly stealing our jobs. And that doesn't go well.""""Much of the West is engaged in a kind of process of looking for scapegoats, as opposed to looking at how we have allowed billionaire interests to dominate our politics and deliver scarcity,‚Äù Goodman said. ‚ÄúI think that's a very concerning combination.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
