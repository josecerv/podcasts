"Thanks For Your Email (auto response) RE: An Invitation from Wharton","I know... Auto-responders are no fun!!!!

I am sorry to be sending you this auto-response. It's really impersonal, but I want you to know a few things.

1) I really appreciate your email. Thanks for sending it.

2) Because of my client schedule I don't always respond right away. I try to craft out time twice a day just to give to my email.

3) I will write you back as soon as I can. If this is REAL SUPER AMAZINGLY IMPORTANT and I don't get back to you right away, please feel free to email me again to remind me.

It is not that I don't care, but I might read your message between clients, not have time in the moment to write you back, and then miss it in my inbox later. Nothing personal, I just sometimes get distracted by shiny objects.

If you ordered a Stage 1 reading, it will be delivered approximately 8 weeks from the date of your request. I'll email you as soon as soon as I can to confirm your info, and the date of your request holds your place in line. Just so you know, I rarely check email on the weekends.  Please reply to that email right away to avoid any delay in delivery of your reading. 

Your reading will be done with great care, as we do for all, as if no one else were waiting. 

Your patient understanding is so needed and much appreciated.  If you ordered a Stage 2 session I will contact you to set up your appointment, via email. Lavandar retired Jan. 1, 2022, so if you have a question for her, just email: lavandar@starseedhotline.com, though she's not checking email very often. I'm booking Stage 2 live sessions about 8 weeks in advance. If you're looking for details about joining us for a Master Class, please email: crystals@starseedhotline.com
We also plan on doing an Advanced Galactic Astrology Class for astrologers in June, so email me if you'd like more details.

"Out of Office: On Maternity Leave (and Probably Covered in Baby Spit-Up)","Hello there!

Thank you for your email! I’m currently on maternity leave, which means I’m knee-deep in newborn cuddles, nappies, and approximately zero hours of uninterrupted sleep. While I may intermittently check my emails (possibly at 3 AM during a feeding session), I won’t be actively responding to work-related inquiries until I return - which is anticipated to be in July or August.

If you're reaching out about advertising, podcast opportunities, or coaching, I truly appreciate your patience, and I’ll get back to you as soon as I emerge from the newborn fog!

In the meantime:

If it’s urgent, try sending me positive vibes and a strong cup of coffee (or just email me again, and I’ll do my best to respond when I can).

If it’s about Thrive Tribe, rest assured the community continues to thrive, and if you are a member, I will get back to you soon!

Thanks for your understanding and support - I’ll be back, hopefully well-rested (wishful thinking?), and ready to dive back in soon!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello and thank you for reaching out to Functional Synergy!

Our service team is normally available from Monday to Friday, and we're away on weekends.  However, we have clients around the world so it's possible we aren't available at the moment, depending on where you are located.  

If you're receiving this reply message, it means we're currently out of the office, and we'll be back and available to assist you soon!

In the meantime, if you have questions about a course you purchased or you need help accessing our programs, here are some troubleshooting tips that might help:

Missing Receipt or Confirmation Email?
If you haven't received a receipt or confirmation email for a course you purchased, and it's been more than an hour, please check your junk/spam folder. If you have more than one email address, it is possible that your payment was made with an alternate email address unintentionally (especially if you paid with Apple Pay or Google Pay!).  Accidental mistakes or typos in your email address at the time of purchase can also cause emails to bounce.  In this case, we will need to update records across our systems, so we will reply back as soon as we're available.  

Where Do I Access My Course/Training?
Most of our programs, including the ""Power Of"" Series, can be found inside our Online Classroom here: https://classroom.functionalsynergy.com/login <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://classroom.functionalsynergy.com/login__;!!IBzWLUs!Q-_6xsOkN7bkc_OMiaTadZcXwUCplzQAiSyPIT0aUpMdGQdSmHXtpLrAfjKNfhx_v0Q-KXiTDyfGI_7a9ZT2tqYFK6tJgz3flv-oyIQ$> .

Troubles Logging Into The Classroom?
If you have tried to reset your password, please wait 10 minutes for the reset password email to be sent. If you did not receive the email, please check your junk/spam folder. If that also doesn't get you in, we'll be able to assist you with this as soon as we're back in the office.

Having Video Playback Problems?
If you're having trouble playing a video, try using a different browser.  Chrome is recommended. Clearing your cache and cookies might also help. If the issue persists, it could be due to computer settings or permissions, which unfortunately, we cannot directly fix.

If you still need assistance, we'll get back to you as soon as we can!  Thank you for being a part of the Functional Synergy community.

I am now out of the office until Wednesday 26th February.  I'm heading South into Englandshire to give a talk at my old Secondary School on the basics of finance, and I'll be seeing a couple of clients while I'm on my travels.

If you are panicking about global events impacting the value of your investments, then please remember, your financial plan already has all of this built in and you are going to be absolutely fine.  Don’t let events that you can’t control impact your decision to live your life to the full.  

On the other hand, if markets are soaring, the value of your portfolio is rising, and you were just getting in touch to congratulate me on a job well done...remember, it's not my fault, markets can go up as well as down!

If you need some money desperately, remember you have an emergency fund in place for such a time as this.  We can top it up for you once I'm back.

Of course...if it's a serious, serious emergency that only we can resolve, or if you are deeply troubled by my absence, then you have permission to get in touch with the team.  Call 01224 972172, explain who you are and ask for Tim, Emilia or Jo.

I'll be back before you know it...

Hey Wharton,

 

Thank you for joining the OneMind Dogs pack!

 

We’re so excited to help you find the magical connection with your dog. Our method will make learning agility super fun and easy to do, and you and your dog will have a blast together!

 

The OneMind Dogs Method was invented by dogs, for dogs. It all began when our leading coach Janita Leinonen’s dog Tekla lost her hearing.

 

Check out this video about how Tekla taught us how to listen, and learn more about how our method works for all dogs around the world.

Thank you for your recent email to Independence Institute.  Although we read every email we receive, it's not always possible to respond to each one.    

 

*	If your email praised our recent activities, thank you very much for your support!

*	If your email detested our recent activities, well isn't that what makes Colorado great?  We can disagree and still live peacefully together! 

*	If your email was chock-full of obscenities, death threats, and other mad ramblings maybe you should ask your parents why they didn't raise you better.  

Finally, if your email was meant for a specific person or center it will be passed along to the appropriate person.

 

Thank you and don't forget to Think Freedom!

 

Very truly yours,

Hi there,

I understand you're inquiring about an invitation from an external organization for a podcast analytics study.

I apologize, but I don't have any information about a Wharton Podcast Analytics Team or a personalized 1-month lookback for Launch Your Private Podcast. This appears to be unrelated to Hello Audio's services.

Our podcast, ""Launch Your Private Podcast,"" is about the power of private podcasting, but it's not associated with Wharton or any analytics team. If you're interested in learning more about private podcasting, you can listen to our podcast on Spotify or Apple Podcasts.

Could you provide more details about this invitation? Is there anything specific about Hello Audio's private podcasting features that you'd like to know more about?

Thank you for getting in touch!
 
Hey! 
We got your message. 
Here are some FAQ's that may be useful. If your query can't be answered below, we will aim to get back to you within 3 working days. 
When will my order ship?
We aim to ship all in stock items in 10 working days, however pre-order items will vary from item to item.
Information on when pre-order items will ship can be found on the product listing information or by checking out the Pre-order Shipping Dates <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/31187354/vice-press.com?p=eyJzIjoicDFZdzFjb2Jrd2l6Q1cwR3p2WHlXejJtcEU0IiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMTE4NzM1NCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3ZpY2UtcHJlc3MuY29tXFxcL3BhZ2VzXFxcL3ByZS1vcmRlci1zaGlwcGluZy1kYXRlc1wiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjEwZmFiYTVmZDZlNzQzMWJhNWI2ODdmNzcxYTM2NzY5XCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiNGY4MjNkYWM3NjkyZTUyM2NkNGZmMmI4MWExOTZhNmE0MGM4MTMzNVwiXX0ifQ__;!!IBzWLUs!UqbkS5z_yUXBFX30CJMqL28duytM2TzVEhNl5zbtOJqz98DbWseTww6eLtlsUxAEZXr-Uxz9fjri3jVvqV1Gf9crfutcf8Y$>  page. You can find more information on shipping on our Shipping Policy <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/31187354/vice-press.com?p=eyJzIjoiV19DRHpOVFpYODIyVWpEMEw4cjY3NUNwVXZNIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMTE4NzM1NCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3ZpY2UtcHJlc3MuY29tXFxcL3BvbGljaWVzXFxcL3NoaXBwaW5nLXBvbGljeVwiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjEwZmFiYTVmZDZlNzQzMWJhNWI2ODdmNzcxYTM2NzY5XCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiNmQ5NDMzMTRhZjNkZDhiZGE2YTExMWIzMDI3OTQzNzhhMDQ5ZWIzNlwiXX0ifQ__;!!IBzWLUs!UqbkS5z_yUXBFX30CJMqL28duytM2TzVEhNl5zbtOJqz98DbWseTww6eLtlsUxAEZXr-Uxz9fjri3jVvqV1Gf9crWj5iXf0$>  page, too.
I received a shipping confirmation email and checked my order tracking, but it says something like ""We're expecting it - The sender has let us know they have despatched your item..."". Why hasn't it been sent yet?
This is completely normal and can say this for several days. We do not have mail collected every day and often it can take a day or two from when we packed your order for it to be collected and scanned. If it is still saying this after 5 working days, please let us know and we can investigate. 
My order was shipped a while ago and it hasn't moved/ is taking ages to get to me - why?
Shipping timescales vary from destination to destination. These can all be found on our Shipping Policy HERE. <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://mandrillapp.com/track/click/31187354/vice-press.com?p=eyJzIjoibUNBbHRNb2Ewd1BJUUFaTlRUQTdRMDM0ZDlzIiwidiI6MSwicCI6IntcInVcIjozMTE4NzM1NCxcInZcIjoxLFwidXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3ZpY2UtcHJlc3MuY29tXFxcL3BhZ2VzXFxcL3NoaXBwaW5nLXBvbGljeVwiLFwiaWRcIjpcIjEwZmFiYTVmZDZlNzQzMWJhNWI2ODdmNzcxYTM2NzY5XCIsXCJ1cmxfaWRzXCI6W1wiZDc5YTM3Mjc2MzI3NDQ3MDUzNWVmMmM2ZTk1YjNlNzZhNzhkMWVmZlwiXX0ifQ__;!!IBzWLUs!UqbkS5z_yUXBFX30CJMqL28duytM2TzVEhNl5zbtOJqz98DbWseTww6eLtlsUxAEZXr-Uxz9fjri3jVvqV1Gf9cr1A_pGE8$>  All of our items are shipped from the UK and as a rule of thumb, UK orders can take up to 5 working days and international items up to 30 working days with Standard Tracked services, and 5 - 10 working days with either DHL or UPS. The most common hold up is customs. It can take the majority of that time to clear customs. However, if your order has taken longer than the above, please let us know and we will investigate.
I ordered a few items and have only received part of it. Is the rest lost or missing?
Sometimes, especially with DVDs, clothing and pin badges, we send these packed separately to posters. (Can you imagine trying to squeeze a DVD into a poster tube?). This means that quite often, orders arrive separately. Sometimes by up to several days. First, check your tracking number which can be found in your shipping confirmation email. This should give you an estimate of when it will arrived. If you still haven't received your full order within 5 working days of the original part of the order, let us know and we can investigate.
My order arrived but it is damaged! What can i do?
First, don't worry! While we pack all of our items in robust packaging, sometimes damages to occur. It is very rare, and we wish we could completely stop it but once an item leaves us, it is in the hands of the postage gods. We will reply within 3 working days telling you what you need to do. 
Hopefully your question can be answered above or by following one of the links included. If not, we will aim to get back to you within 3 working days.
All the best
James & Matt
