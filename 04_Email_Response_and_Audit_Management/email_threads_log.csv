Podcasts: Latoya Brooks,"Hi Latoya, Thank you for reaching out and showing interest in being interviewed on SalesPOP! A warm welcome to you on SalesPOP! SalesPOP! is a platform to educate, inspire, motivate, and connect. To be in our circle means that you will meet like-minded people, learn from them, get inspired, connect, and create a win-win. We are handpicking every one of them by looking thoroughly at their work, messages, books, speeches, and projects. SalesPOP! was founded a couple of years ago as the extended arm of pipelinersales ( www.pipelinersales.com ), a company founded by Nikolaus Kimla ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/nikolauskimla/ ). He is a true entrepreneur and leader for more than 25 years and stands for the mission and philosophy of our daily business. Pipelinersales stands out not only through its amazing product but also because of the philosophy behind it - the Austrian School of Economics. We firmly believe that only ongoing education can guarantee sustainable success within and through the work of a company. Education can happen in many ways, but we must always be equipped with the right toolset to master whatever challenge comes our way. This toolset needs to be updated occasionally and brought to state-of-the-art. The daily challenges require us to stay flexible and be prepared for the unprecedented by updating our “toolbox” constantly. The interview takes about 15-20 minutes and is conducted by our CMO and editor-in-chief, John Golden ( https://www.linkedin.com/in/johngolden/ ). Please find John Golden’s Calendly link below: https://scheduler.pipelinersales.com/john-golden/sales-pop-interview After the interview is recorded, it will be turned into a podcast so that our international audience can listen to it anytime and wherever they are. We will also set up your contributor page, where everything about you and your work and publications will be featured. Please send us updates about events, book releases, etc..! The interviews and podcasts are published on our website, our YouTube channel, and various podcast channels. They are promoted and shared through our various social media channels, our YouTube channel, weekly emails and newsletters, and by the interviewees. Last but not least, would you please provide me with a short bio, a headshot and all your social media links including your LinkedIn profile?! We are excited to welcome you for an interview.

We aim to share insights from entrepreneurs who have navigated the challenges of growth, hiring, leadership, and scaling a business - not just from a strategic level, but from lived experience. At this time, we are not featuring: 🚫 Marketing agencies 🚫 Business coaches or consultants (unless they have scaled a business previously) 🚫 Real estate professionals 🚫 Financial advisors or wealth managers 🚫 Law or tax firms We are specifically looking for business owners and entrepreneurs who have built their businesses beyond $1M+ in annual revenue and can share actionable lessons from their journey - whether that’s scaling pains, hiring challenges, operational insights, or leadership struggles. If you know someone who fits this profile, we’d love to hear about them. Otherwise, We sincerely appreciate you reaching out, and wish you all the best! Best, The Podcast Team",,,,,,,,,,,,

podcast over Zoom video call. I don't know much about you, if you have
a portfolio, social media accounts, youtube channel etc... We would
like to be able to build a show around you. Finally is there a fee for
having you as a guest? We have never paid for a guest, all of our
guests are all voluntary and just passionate individuals who want to
give their experiences, and opinions about what they love.


Thanks in advance,",,,,,,,,,,,,

My format is a 4-Futurist round table sharing their sound-bite predictions on my topic of the week – “The Future of ___ + AI”…. [an industry / business / creative genre / skill set / lifestyle … ] I welcome topic suggestions and if I agree to the topic, the person making the pitch then engages a full panel of four Futurists from different organizations.

Due to the popularity and longevity of The Sales Podcast—11+ years and over 700 episodes—I've had to make some changes to handle the flood of pitches I receive. I will consider a swap with your recommended guest if they have a podcast or a trade with your company, i.e., I accept your client on The Sales Podcast, and you get me a placement on another show. Here is my speaker sheet. Wes Schaeffer Speaker Profile Wes Schaeffer Speaker Sheet.pdf https://hubs.ly/Q0390Hm80 Or I ask for a small retainer to offset the cost of production and promotion of your guest.

As a podcast host, it's important to me to only accept qualified individuals to be guests, which means I have to carefully vet each request. Your areas of expertise sound great, but there is nothing on your website or that you provided to me that would allow me to understand why you are qualified to speak about those topics (no articles you've written, prior guest appearances, etc) so I'm not able to adequately assess you as a guest. I know that it can be hard early on when trying to get your first guest appearance, which may not be your case and if so, I hope you'll send me examples from your prior work, but even if you record a few solo videos and put them on your website, where you can showcase your ability to present your thoughts on a given topic, it would go far in positioning you as a qualified expert. Again, apologies if I've overstepped here. I don't write personal notes to many people, but I try to be supportive of young women in this space because I remember how hard it was for me to get my footing. Wishing you all the best, Mamie",,,,,,,,,,,,

We truly appreciate you thinking of the Art of Coaching Podcast! To ensure each guest is a fit for our audience, as well as the tone/feel of our podcast, we ask for any interested party to fill out this form to be considered for a future show. It's not just about the resume and experience of each guest, but also the flow of conversation between Brett and the guest and how vulnerable they are willing to be with their information, stories, and tactical takeaways they provide to the audience. It also helps if they are somewhat familiar with the show themselves so we can ensure they truly understand the audience and the show's mission. We currently have our upcoming schedule set but we review guest submissions regularly. We'd be happy to consider your application once it is submitted. Enjoy your day, and thanks again for reaching out to us! With Appreciation, Team AoC",,,,,,,,,,,,

I looked at the suggested points for a conversation. As you may know, the Software People Stories podcast focuses more on the personal and professional journeys of our guests. It is not intended to be a technical podcast. The primary audience for the podcast are people associated with software. If your experience in helping teams and individuals also covers the IT industry, along with your own experience as a business strategist, it would make it interesting and valuable for the listeners. These are unscripted conversations, that start with a self-introduction and then I let my curiosity take over. If you are comfortable with this format and focus, we can work out a mutually convenient time to record. I record the conversation on Zoom. I am based in Bangalore, India [IST is 5:30 hours ahead of UTC]. Where are you based?

I genuinely appreciate you thinking of us. I wanted to take a moment to clarify the focus of our show. The Prison Officer Podcast maintains a very specific mission: to spotlight the experiences of those who have served as correctional officers - the men and women who know firsthand what it means to sit 16 hours in a Segregation Unit, eat meals off inmate trays, and handle the most challenging aspects of institutional life, including responding to violence, and inmate self-harm incidents. Our podcast was created specifically to give voice to these ""forgotten cops"" of our jails and prisons who often receive the leftover equipment, leftover training, and leftover respect within the criminal justice system. I've made a commitment to put their stories and experiences at the forefront. Based on your background, I don't believe our podcast would be the right platform for your expertise at this time. However, I'm always open to discussing this further if you feel there's an angle I've overlooked regarding your connection to correctional work. If you'd like to discuss this further, feel free to reach me directly at mike",,,,,,,,,,,,

Your willingness to share your insights and stories with us—and, by extension, our listeners—promises to make for an enriching episode that aligns perfectly with our mission to delve deep into the cultural impact of storytelling. As partners in this journey, Dominick Domingo and I are eager to weave your unique perspectives into the fabric of our podcast. Since launching in November 2023, we've amassed over 50 insightful episodes, engaging audiences on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, IHeartRadio, and Buzzsprout, to name a few. Your voice is set to join a diverse chorus of storytellers who have captivated our listeners with their compelling narratives. For that reason, to let you know a bit about the spirit and intent of the podcast, here’s a brief description: LANGUAGE of the SOUL Podcast Based on Dominick Domingo’s acclaimed book by the same name, Language of the Soul Podcast explores the infinite ways in which life, simply put, is story. Individually, we’re all products of the stories we’ve been exposed to. Collectively, culture is the sum of its history. Our respective worldviews are little more than stories we tell about ourselves. Socialization is the amalgamation of narratives we weave about the human condition, shaping everything from the codes we live by to policy itself. Language of the Soul Podcast spotlights master storytellers in the Arts and Entertainment, from cinema to the literary realm. It explores topical social issues through the lens of narrative, with an eye on the march toward human potential. And as always, a nudge to embrace the power of story in our lives… Here's What Happens Next? Scheduling Your Episode: We're excited to find a time that fits your schedule for our conversation. Please choose a recording slot via our scheduling link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0_49qZE7cccMlxTT43LvGMx1FrapXTccZ54VIrRUETUmweQ-fM1aGofYva0fAkaDJlM-57pPG0?gv=true . Our recording sessions are conducted on Sundays between 11 AM and 6 PM PST, utilizing Zoom for an audio-only format to ensure comfort and flexibility. Getting to Know You Better: Understanding your journey and the stories you wish to share is crucial for a meaningful conversation. We kindly ask you to complete our brief guest questionnaire here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj_A2ZT4uSRt37IAqRt0sTjiAo0fYKGd7z_I7hqqKpfc99IQ/viewform?usp=sf_link . This form is an opportunity to share your preferred bio, any links you'd like featured alongside your episode, and the topics or stories you're passionate about. Completing this form lets Dominick fully understand who you are as our guest. *Please note that if this form is not completed, we will need to cancel you as a guest. We do this because we want to put out good content and have you represented in the best light possible, and only you can do that by answering our questions as completely as possible . Preparing for the Recording: Before our recording session, we'll email you the final details, including the Zoom link, and address any queries you might have. This pre-session communication is the perfect opportunity to highlight specific themes or questions you'd like us to cover. Looking Ahead: Your contribution to the Language of the Soul Podcast is invaluable. It's not merely about sharing your narrative; it's about igniting inspiration and offering enlightenment through the compelling power of stories. We are dedicated to crafting an episode that not only showcases your unique contributions but also deeply resonates with our audience. We highly suggest listening to a few of our episodes before scheduling your appearance on our show. We eagerly anticipate you joining us to share your story with the world. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or require additional information.",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also know that “Predictions and Trends”, “Insights into AI”, “All about Customer Experience”, “How to be a Thought Leader”, or “How to drive more sales” are not stories I’m looking for, and I’m not focused on the enterprenuerial journey as a story. You’re welcome to revisit this in a way that makes sense for what I’m looking for.

Thank you for the very professional email. Right now I’m not booking any new guests. I am taking on a select number of authors and entrepreneurs as 1:1 coaching clients. After hosting over 300 episodes and working closely with busy founders, my specialty is helping good communicators level up their on-mic appearances (podcasts, keynotes, presentations) so that when they do land opportunities they make the absolute most of those opportunities. Does this sound like a value add for you or anyone you know? Here’s a quick look at some TESTIMONIALS Thanks for thinking of me.  Who knows where this email might lead. Warmly, Joe",,,,,,,,,,,,

Always looking for someone that can bring a different perspective on doing business and add insight to what we are all trying to do out here as small business owners. The podcast is audio only, but I like to connect via Streamyard for the recording just so we have a visual connection, it just seems a little more personal. I will apologize ahead of time that you get to visually chat with an old dude that has a face for radio(even though we own a video production studio)🤣 The podcast is typically 30-45 minutes, sometimes longer, just depends on how well we can drive the conversation. All total it is about an hour to your time from login to completing the podcast and will focus on your background, how you got to where you are today, your business insights and then perhaps how you are giving back to the community if that is something that you do. If you are willing, I like to have just a quick Zoom call type of intro just so you can ask any question and get comfortable with how it will all happen. It is not live so there is no pressure and we are not under a time crunch so it is pretty casual, I like to have fun on the podcast and learn something along the way. If you would like to connect in the next week or so, let me know and we will set something up and go from there. Thanks again for reaching out and I hope to hear from you soon!!

I hope you’ve had a chance to listen to a few episodes. Secondly, I appreciate you considering being a guest on the podcast. However, to help me focus on the theme of The Life Shift, I’d like to know if you’d be willing to share a pivotal moment in your life that changed everything. These moments are usually personal and significant. I prefer to get as specific as possible. My challenge with guests is to help them identify one specific moment in their lives that changed everything. For some, it’s a phone call, an email, or a diagnosis. I like to have a conversation centered around the moment the guest feels was most pivotal. When I first started The Life Shift Podcast , I thought my life shift was when my mom passed away when I was 8. However, after recording all these conversations, I’ve reflected and narrowed down the moment. My initial shift wasn’t when she died, but when my father had to sit me down and tell me the news. The specific words he uttered, “Your mom died in an accident” (or whatever he actually said), were the moment that truly shifted my life. It’s funny how listening to others’ stories helps us reflect more deeply on our own experiences. I recorded an episode about my journey, and you might want to listen to it first: https://",,,,,,,,,,,,

The audience is worldwide with most of our listeners being in Australia and the USA. If you could please provide me with some more information, maybe a link to your LinkedIn profile or a speaker one-sheet.  And also a paragraph of what you think are the top 3 issues affecting leaders of emerging health businesses today?

I would be honored to have you as a guest on my podcast!  I should probably double-check a couple of things just to manage expectations a bit.  My format on the podcast is somewhat ""rapid fire,"" meaning I try to keep the entire episode to around 15 minutes.  Also, I ask the same 5 questions of all the guests.  This gives my followers different perspectives on the same concept to consider.  If that sounds okay to you, then please go to teamengagementpodcast.com where you can review the questions I'm asking the guests this season.  There's also a calendar link at the bottom of the page where you can schedule a time. Would you mind connecting with me on LinkedIn?  I always like to connect with my guests on LinkedIn when possible.  Here's my profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnjrichards/ Oh, one other thing (again, just to manage expectations): I'm currently booked through this month, so the calendar will show times in April when we can record the podcast, and then it will be released some time in May.  I hope that timing works okay for you. Thanks Latoya!  I hope to have you on the podcast soon!  Have a great day!",,,,,,,,,,,,

We appreciate you taking the time to share your background with us. At this time, based on the information you provided, we don’t feel it’s the right fit for our audience. Here are the criteria we are looking for when Sharon interviews a guest on The Innovative Agency Podcast: Sharon is an attorney who helps marketing agencies protect their Intellectual Property, generate new streams of revenue from existing assets, and make sure that the 4 Critical Legal Documents are properly in place to mitigate unnecessary risks. The Innovative Agency Podcast exists to help marketing agency leaders answer the questions: “What’s Next?” How are agencies staying on the cutting edge of marketing trends? (Think AI, how agencies innovated a new process or IP to create growth, how the agency is creating new revenue streams, etc.) How are they adapting their businesses to meet new business challenges in the agency world? (Think changes in software or tools that allow for reaching customers in new ways, etc.) This is because each of these innovations also comes with legal considerations. The guest should use their expertise and stories of what they are doing from an innovation standpoint to showcase their smarts and capabilities while doing it in a way others can try to emulate. Sincerely, Lora Howdyshell Client Relationship Manager & Executive Assistant Toerek Law Office:",,,,,,,,,,,,

This will cover the cost of my pre and post-production, plus emailing your episode to my list of over 14k contacts.

I’d be happy to chat with you about being a guest. Importantly, I have a strong theme and premise to my podcast and I always want guests to follow this. If this doesn’t happen, then the “magic” is never created. It’s a truly passion project for me (I have a day job and have always worked in NFP’s and human services) and is primarily driven by the transcendent experiences I get from literally every story. Each episode is generally between 25 – 35 minutes and can easily be recorded over Zoom. It’s always a casual process and only the audio track is used for the episode (no vision is used). Attached is a “Guest Information sheet” that will continue to give you some understanding of the premise … which is simply … I have found the best way to approach each episode is for the guest to focus on a single experience or story within their life, … and not necessarily their overall life story. I am a big believer in ‘pivotal’ moments and situations where you experienced something very specific as being the best places to start the episodes . I’m located in Perth, Western Australia so if you able to chat over Zoom, I’ll try to fit into your availability. Please let me know what suits. Best Regards Tony Hagan (AKA Max)",,,,,,,,,,,,

You would be a fantastic guest on the show! Passage to Profit Show is a weekly nationally syndicated radio show & podcast showcasing entrepreneurs from various backgrounds and industries. Our show is about discussing guests' entrepreneurial journeys and their innovations. We are currently syndicated on 37 radio stations across the country on the Radio America Network and on iHeartRadio. The podcast comes out after the show airs on the radio. There are 3 options to join the show as guest: 1.) Guests can join via Zoom from their location, for which there is a $100 booking fee. 2.) We offer the additional opportunity for guests who want the full studio experience to tape their show at iHeart Studios in Manhattan! Guests will have opportunities to take photos and video in the state of the art brand new iHeart Studios and with the iHeart logo. We will also create a social media video reel that they can use for their promotions from their interview. The fee for the iHeartRadio NYC taping is $250. 3.) If you are not interested in paid opportunities but interested in the show, please still let us know. We can put you on our list and keep you in mind for a last minute spot that needs to be filled (no fee!). The show does not gain a profit from the fees, rather it helps to pay for the costs of the guest’s episode to air on 37 radio stations across the country! Attached is our media kit for review. Please let us know if you are interested in any of the 3 options.",,,,,,,,,,,,

While we are certainly happy and enthusiastic about helping get the word out about people's professional projects, are you open to sharing your story on a more personal level? 3) Can you please give a few more details about you and your vegan journey, including where you live, how long you've been evegan, and any other relevant personal details?",,,,,,,,,,,,

Podcast - Finding Empowerment Embracing Layers: Latoya Brooks,"Hi Latoya, Thanks so much for reaching out and being interested in being a guest on The F.E.E.L Podcast. Our framework is a little unique in how we approach our interviews, as we use a talking point format that really allows our listeners to get to know the person for who they are first, and then what they do can come up organically as we go through the conversations.  I recommend listening to a couple of episodes to get a feel for how the conversations flow. You can find those here: https://www.embracinglayers.com/episodes I am booked out through the Fall already, but would love to connect with you in November as I prepare to set up recordings for Spring 2026.  Let me know if that is something you would be interested in after you've listened to some content to hear how our conversations go. Take care, and thanks so much for the work you do on behalf of and for women! I look forward to hearing from you.

My name is Cyndal and I’m with our podcast booking team! We appreciate the outreach and interest in Be BOLD Branding! Tonya and Michael personally hold small group calls for people interested in appearing, where they can learn about your story and who you serve . That helps us both in 2 ways. 1-we get to know you and where you story would best fit in the line-up and 2-sometimes candidates meet potential clients on those calls! We also belong to an ENTIRE NETWORK of top level podcasters who are looking for great guests. We can make introductions to other hosts after the call (that fit the audience you want to reach) to help you gain more visibility. OK, I say all of that to let you know that it is NOT a prerequisite to becoming a client of ours in order to be interviewed, although that happens pretty often. :) If we can be helpful to you GREAT. If not, Tonya or Michael probably know someone who can (We have a huge network of highly successful problem solvers like them). If that sounds good…here’s a little more info about us. Our 𝘉𝘦 𝘉𝘖𝘓𝘋 𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 podcast features coaches/consultants who have bold ‘behind the business’ stories. People we work with tend to have their hands in multiple projects (coaching, podcasting, speaking, writing, etc) but they’re not nearly as profitable as they should be. That’s why we build 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴 (it’s all we do) and most of our clients walk away charging at least 60% more for their services. For now, though…please use this link and schedule a call so Tonya can hear your story and see how it fits in the line-up! https://go.oncehub.com/VIPPodguest Cyndal Dunn- Be BOLD Branding Booking Agent Cyndal",,,,,,,,,,,,

A couple things about the Power of Partnership podcast. Our guests are all deeply influenced and impacted by the work of Dr. Riane Eisler. You can listen to Episode 1 of the series to learn more about her work and then to see if you would still be interested in being a guest (i.e., meaning her work is deeply embedded in your philosophy and approach to the work that you do). Second, the PoP podcast is a project of The Center for Partnership Systems which is a 501-c-3 non-profit and not able to pay our podcast casts. Best, Cherri",,,,,,,,,,,,

The topics you mentioned—transforming challenges into opportunities, navigating change, building confidence, and turning setbacks into stepping stones—are incredibly relevant, and we believe our listeners would greatly benefit from your insights. Your 15 years of experience are impressive, and we’d love to explore the possibility of having you as a guest on our show. That said, we’d love to get to know you a bit more beyond your professional expertise. Would you mind sharing more about your personal journey, your passions, and how you connect with your audience outside of your work? Additionally, if you have any social media handles or personal platforms where we can learn more about your story, that would be fantastic! Season two of Growing In Community will be resuming in June, and we’re currently planning the lineup of guests. Let’s schedule a time to discuss the details and how we can best highlight your expertise and personal story. Please let me know your availability, and we can arrange a call or meeting to move forward. Looking forward to connecting soon!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
