Thank you for this email.  Unfortunately I clicked the link before I was completely ready to provide my information to complete the process.  Can you “reset” me in your system so I can go back and complete the 6 month lookback?  

Thank you for providing this service.  I am excited to see what information you have to share.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey team,

Thanks for the email. So that we are crystal clear. You are basically asking me to invest my time in providing you with data, correct?

Also what does ""To help you set goals for the future"" mean exactly?

It is not entirely clear. It seems like you want to map out podcast networks manually and then do something with this data. 

Thanks,

Levi

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Good morning,

 

Thank you for your email and interest in our podcast series. I would like to fully understand the commitment on our end before exploring further. I do believe the information you could provide would possibly help us in obtaining additional sponsorship. We do not make money on the podcasts, we just try to offset the expenses incurred with each episode – we too are a non profit organization giving back to our community. 

 

Please let me know the time commitment, what you would need from us and if there is any financial costs now or in the future for the final report.

Warm regards

Thanks for this! I did the lookback, but unfortunately I must have closed it out before I clicked the option to email myself a copy. Is there any way you can send, and can you also provide more information on the service that was mentioned around finding new, verified guests?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello. I was interested in seeing what your report might bring but the data is incorrect. I don’t have a guest on every episode so you’re asking me questions about a guest that doesn’t exist. And I publish an episode every week so I’m not sure where you got the number 10 episodes.

Good morning, 

 

I received this very legitimate-looking email from your team that looks too good to be true. Are you really offering a free analysis of my podcast or is there a pretty sophisticated scam out there using Wharton’s good name to gain credibility?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Team, 

Thank you for your interest and reaching out with some metrics. I welcome an array of guests and appreciate your leads list. However, our topic here is rather specific and many are still afraid to talk about it. We speak about UFOs and Spirituality. 

If you are aware of any of the folks on your lead list that are not afraid to talk about this with us, please let me know. From an encounter to abduction, research to UFO crash site, everything in between and we always talk about how it plays into our belief systems. 

Again, thank you for your time and assistance.

"Question about Podcast Analytics","Hello Warton Team, 

If you don’t mind me asking, I took a survey and reviewed the results after completing it. It seemed a bit elementary for Wharton. I could have dropped that data into an Excel spreadsheet and spent the same amount of time getting the same or more results. I think your recommendations were OK. There may have been 10% of the people you recommended that might fit the show. However, just putting their LinkedIn profile on a page seemed strange. Did they approach you to advertise or recommend them? Did you have an algorithm that found and put random names on that list? Is the list the same for all podcasts?


What is your goal? Is this a study that you are looking at other aspects of our responses without telling us? Why would you recommend guests to my podcast? What is your angle?

 

I realize I asked you a lot of questions, but I am genuinely curious about what you are trying to accomplish.


Enjoy the week,

Dallas

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey, Wharton podcast team. Super cool that you exist! Would love to learn more about how this initiative came to be.

Is there a big podcast presence at the school? I've been working in podcasting since 2017 (I write a podcast recommendation newsletter, host a bunch of shows about the industry, work for a production company,...etc) and am always interested when higher ed gets involved.

Would love to chat,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Thank you for reaching out and for recognizing Present Potential! It’s incredible to hear that your team has taken an interest in the podcast.

I’d love to participate in the personalized lookback you’ve created. Present Potential is a project that I’ve been building solo, so I’m always looking for ways to gain insights and improve. Your analysis sounds like a valuable opportunity to reflect on the past few months and set meaningful goals for the future.

I’ll review the lookback and complete it soon. Let me know if there’s anything else I should keep in mind, and I appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with Wharton’s Podcast Analytics Team.

Looking forward to staying in touch!

Hassan

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey Team -

Happy to fill out the survey (I know this is automated but I’m a ‘21 Wharton MBA so I have a little extra motivation to help)

Biggest question: could you give examples of how this might help me? Would be great to understand the non-profit mission before going through the manual effort of data tagging.

Thanks!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi there,

So many scams these days...how do I know you're from Wharton?  What is this for? Why is this free? What will you want from me? Where will this data be used?  Why would Wharton want to help me set goals for the future?

Thanks

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi

Thank you for my email. I am curious to learn more about the objectives of your project, and I have some feedback for you. 


For example, your wording is unclear and didn't meet my expectations when I clicked the link. 
""The lookback involves reviewing and classifying the guests you’ve hosted in the last 2 months to help set goals for the future.""


You set up the expecation that you are giving us a 2 month lookback by sharing the bullet points of what you've ""already auto-tabulated."" Then you are making it sound like it's something you are giving us with ""To help you set goals for the future."" 


At this point, I'm thinking to myself, ""I don't need a 2 month lookback because I planned the last 2 months of content. I also don't need help setting goals for the future because we have our own strategy."" 

I thought, ""well, I don't really need the info you're offering, but I'll check it out after I check that there is actually a Wharton Podcast Analytics Team. It's very peculiar that it isn't signed off by a person, so maybe this isn't a legitimate email."" 


Then I get to the link expecting to see my 2 month lookback, but I'm being asked to classify my own podcast guests, the individuals that we invited to be guests based on the strategy we created. Also, you are asking me to classify them by race, gender, and age range (all of our guests are SUD professionals). Our podcast strategy was to interview one addiction professional from every state. We worked very hard to get as diverse of participants as possible, despite the fact that the majority of addiction professionals are white females. We tried to amplify voices of people at different stages of their career, too. One week we interviewed a young woman who had just become qualified followed by a professional who shared that she is in her 70s. I definitely don't want to be filling out a form guessing which person's race is ""other."" It's not my place to look at people and guess their age, gender or race.

In my opinion, you have the ""why"" all wrong in your email. You're making it sound like there's something in it for me as a podcast producer. Feeling uncomfortable making judgements and classifications about the race and gender of my fantastic guests is not something for me. Having a ""lookback"" summarizing what I already know isn't for me either. Participating in Wharton research could be for me if I knew more about your aims. Honestly, whatever your aims, I'm not judging and classifying my guests in the way you've asked. 

I am really hoping that this project is about you doing some research but that's not what you've said in your email. 

If a human wants to speak to me about my feedback or tell me more about the project, feel free to call me on the number below. 

This feedback is sent in the spirit of helpfulness because getting people to participate in surveys can be hard. As a former English teacher and a Co-Founder of a marketing agency, I thought my feedback might be helpful.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","I think what you are doing is super fascinating: oddly enough, you chose a time to analyze us during the one low period we've had in 11 months! We're finally starting to pick things up, now.

I'm responding to you mostly because I just wanted to make sure this was a legitimate email: there were some discrepancies in the message header that indicate this email may not be legit, but I'm hoping that message at least reaches a legitimate sender to confirm.

Otherwise, happy to participate. It sounds like a lot of fun!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Good morning,

Thank you for considering the Rachel Unpacked podcast for this opportunity to analyze the episodes.

I will personally go in and explore the links you have provided, further. 

In the meantime, know that in 2024 the show was mostly a solo cast, where as this year the guests I have coming on are absolutely phenomenal female founders many of which are 7 and 8 figure entrepreneurs. To analyze guest interviews for your look-back, 2023 I interviewed a female billionaire founder, and several 7 and 8 figure female founders. 

Warmest regards,

Rachel Medina

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi,
Thank you for the email. I’m wondering where you pulled your statistics from? We’ve published an episode a week for 3 years and have over 160 episodes. In the past 6 months, we’ve published 26 episodes. 

I’m interested in your offer, but based on the inaccurate data you provided I don’t feel confident that a “lookback” with the Wharton team would be beneficial.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Wharton team, this is some great automation but I think you missed something a little bit bigger than our Sales and Marketing podcast. We have over 21 different podcasts, go here to check them out https://oggn.com/podcasts/ <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://oggn.com/podcasts/__;!!IBzWLUs!QvhtJ3yQEPLxTOPqQT8dUsqilZ-IipP6ofF6R2xbLCxeP_rRUsTPLSDPAUS47Oojs8MK6zW93zjvYViw1YCZctCvLiPjIC31UDI$> . And having a research background myself, I'd be more interested in what the entire suite of podcasts are doing, especially in such a niched industry and subject as oil and gas. 

And our Sales and Marketing podcast is one of our smaller audiences. Our largest audience, and also the largest industry podcast in the world is Oil and Gas This Week. I'd be interested in learning more about your research of what you're trying to accomplish. 

Always happy to schedule a call…

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Good morning! 

Thank you so much for reaching out regarding this opportunity and the show These Are Questions. Would definitely be interested in being a part of this study and analysis to use for the foundation and future course studies.

Im actually currently filming season 8 of the show and preparing to release episodes in early March. Would  you like me to complete the study now or as Season Eight beings to air. 

I'm open to insight and even a interview perspective if you would like to learn more about the intention of the show when it first came out.

Thank you again and have a great rest of your morning!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Literally nothing in this report is correct.  If you count bonus episodes, I've released 15 episodes in the past two months, or only 5 episodes without them.  Including bonus episodes, I've had 4 guests in the past two months, or 2 without them.  I tried following the link to fill out your survey, but only one of the episodes I was asked about featured a guest, making your survey completely pointless.

Try harder.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey! 
Thanks for reaching out and for putting together these insights on The GroShow Podcast! I appreciate the work you’re doing to help podcasters analyse their guest portfolios and content trends.
Before moving forward, I had a few questions:

*	Can you share an example of the type of insights or reports you’ve provided for other podcasts?
*	What data do you collect, and how is it used?
*	Will I have full access to the analysis, and is there any follow-up required on my end?

I’d love to understand how this process works and whether the insights could help refine our content strategy. Looking forward to your response!
Cheers,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Good Morning!
Thank you for you reaching out, as I would be very interested in this lookback. However, I took about a 3 month hiatus from July to October. I'm wondering if I could defer the opportunity until the 1st of May and then take advantage of the 6 month lookback?

Please let me know.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Thank you for reaching out and for this incredible initiative, this kind of support is a true blessing for creators like me who are testing, iterating, and trying new things. I’ve completed the form and would love the opportunity to connect for a quick chat, if you're open to that.

I’m currently pivoting in my approach, as I’ve found it challenging to secure guests as an outsider in the sport industry. I’ve explored solo episodes with video, which is why I also started a YouTube channel. Here's my portfolio <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://classic-reminder-a56.notion.site/iolanda-s-vibe-check-my-Portfolio-17b0edf1338980e18c69c57d6aa910d4?pvs=4__;!!IBzWLUs!Rgc_2hzZWtSQZU5583Eug-CWGje5NorDnAE59qY7UuhoXbmWdog7ffsCo648Ds0A4ulz70YRmnKYTOrO5ASXLDazHecyKXq1GF3e2NmkbQ$>  if you'd like to know more.

On another note, if there’s any way to collaborate or partner on future initiatives, I’d be more than happy to explore that as well.

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

I recently received an opportunity to do a 2-month look back and was provided a list of potential guests. First, thank you – this was incredibly valuable. Second, how do individual get on the potential guests list? How was my podcast selected? 

 

I appreciate the 2-month look back, and I am interested in learning how I may be able to be added to your potential guests list.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","I'm happy to participate but in full transparency, our podcast is doing less guest interviews and more solo episodes by myself. 

So a retrospective look at the show would not really add value in the direction we are going as we're leaving that behind.

I mean I post a weekly show that is 30-45 minutes — I have been doing for close to 4 years.
 
So not sure if the goals here really make sense. Unless I am missing something.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton team,

thanks so much for including me in this study. I think it is a very creative way to provide actionable resources to podcast creators, and also gather data to further your own research.

Thanks for providing such a well-constructed initial email, survey, and informational data.

The researcher in me sees it as a perfect value give, value add scenario for both you and me and that is something I can appreciate.

Thanks,
Daniel Dahlinger

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,
Thank you for reaching out and for your kind words about the Introverted Entrepreneur podcast. I appreciate your interest in supporting podcast creators through data-driven insights and analysis.
Before I consider participating in the personalized lookback you’ve offered, I’d like to better understand a few things:

1.	
	Purpose and Usage of Data: Could you clarify how the data gathered through this analysis will be used? Is it strictly for the benefit of the participating podcasters, or will it contribute to research or other external projects?
2.	
	Selection Criteria: You mentioned that you’re inviting “top hosts” — could you share how that distinction is determined and how my podcast was selected?
3.	
	Long-Term Engagement: What happens after the 3-month lookback? Is there any further involvement, cost, or commitment associated with this process?
4.	
	Value of Insights: Could you provide a clearer idea of the types of insights this analysis typically reveals and how they’ve helped other podcasters? I want to ensure this aligns with my goals and the direction of my content.

Thank you again for this opportunity. I look forward to hearing from you and understanding more about how this collaboration could be mutually beneficial.
Warm regards,
Denise G. Lee

Hi! 
Thanks so much for reaching out and sharing the guest insights above. I love to support nonprofits. 

Can you first explain the benefit of filling out the survey and how classifying guests will help me set goals? 

Appreciate it!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Guys,

Thanks for reaching out. I'm maybe the worst (or maybe the best) podcast to reach out about analytics considering I'm a data scientist. 

My honest feedback is I did all the work here haha. I didn't find it very helpful at all. I'm honestly wondering if this is a survey disguised as analytics? Because just regurgitating what I just told you in percentages is not helpful. Also, it was confusing because 50% of my episodes are ""guest-less"".

Anyways, that's my harsh feedback. But I hope you find it helpful from one analyst to another.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","To whom it may concern,

Thank you but I don't think I need such an analysis. The podcast is literally a one-man operation just for fun and my goals are clear to me.

Also I clicked on the link and the survey seems to be not suitable for my needs. For example, you ask if my podcast guests are ""US based"" or ""international"", when the whole point of my podcast is interviewing people from different countries...

Kind regards,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi, 

Thanks for reaching out. I did the survey and while it does seem to suggest that our show should diversify our guests, I wanted to caveat that this is not possible for our show because we tell the stories of testicular cancer survivors and cover topics with subject-matter experts.

While the ages and professions of our guests can vary, the through line is testicular cancer.

I appreciate what you all are doing and I hope this helps in your data collection!

Thanks,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi there,

I took the guest look back but would prefer to do the Historical Trend Analysis if that's possible?

My show is 2/3 solo episodes (1/3 guest episodes) with 2 per week so that would be more relevant/pertinent.

Let me know (and hopefully such an analysis would give you some good data).

Thanks!
Philip

	Hello, and thanks for reaching out. How in god's creation did you find us? We are a tiny nonprofit in Northern California with less than 100 downloads!! We could use all the help we can get. Our biggest challenge is the fact that we are hyper-local--although we do have nationally-recognized highly-talented guests with the topic of community being more important than ever. Much of what we do here could be modeled for other nonprofit community centers around the country. We appreciate any help you can offer.

"Re: Alter Eagle Podcast","Hello,

Thank you for this, I just finished the survey of those episodes. I am curious how you decided which episodes to include? The first episode dropped February 5, 2024, with the 53rd regular episode dropping next Monday and 4 Bonus episodes through the season, for a total of 57 episodes. Would it be possible for me to connect through a zoom to discuss learn more about your program?

Thank You,
Laura

Subject: Alter Eagle Podcast 
 
Hello,

My name is Laura Crago, I am the producer and host of the 'Alter Eagle' podcast and responding to an email that was sent earlier today to my boss, Tammy Schuey, General Manager and Publisher of Eagle Printing. 

I attached the original email text below my signature panel. I am interested in connecting with someone to learn more about participating in your non-profit program for a 3-month lookback. I did try clicking on the link for the lookback but it advised me it had been filled out or expired. We didn't fill it out and would like to do so. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind Regards,
Laura

		I don't quite understand this email. The tabulated information on us is completely wrong, we have close to 600 podcast episodes on YouTube, not 10. 
		I'm happy to learn more about this, but everything so far has been inaccurate. Can you tell me a little more about what this is?

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Thanks, but we can track our guests fine.  FWIW, we actually put out about 50 episodes in the past six months and had fewer than twelve guests.  Just letting you know your auto-tabulation is pretty far off the mark.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi there.


This is super interesting.  We work with a few different high ed podcasts, including 4 more at Stanford.  We produce monthly podcast analytics reports for all of our podcast partners.


I'll share this email with the Stanford Engineering team.


Can we chat further about what you're building?


You might be interest in another of our projects: HigherEdPods.com <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://higheredpods.com/__;!!IBzWLUs!T6xuE_aYe900WAhk3kAZgZUsszUjbWh_691qX0OJdAwMc-KprM6d250lbzzoSslfb5T6dTWyYU0u75-RkFxK6EmdaEhX2HIfLA$>  (a directory and community for Higher Ed Podcasts).  We're also working on the inaugural higher ed podcaster conference in Chicago in July: HigherEdPodCon.com <https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://higheredpodcon.com/__;!!IBzWLUs!T6xuE_aYe900WAhk3kAZgZUsszUjbWh_691qX0OJdAwMc-KprM6d250lbzzoSslfb5T6dTWyYU0u75-RkFxK6EmdaEgwGpdtEA$>  … perhaps you'd be interested in talking about your project to a room full of academic podcasters?


Best.

"Re: Wharton Podcast Analytics","Dear Mystery Person,  Thank you for answering my email.

I have a few questions for you.  Don't even know whom I am speaking with.

1.  What ways are you able to offer services to our Podcast Ministry? And can you provide the costs for each?

2.  I am not getting demographics just yet from Google as we just started SEO on our site in June of last year.  Can you provide me tools to send to my speakers.  Most of the Podcast platforms we are in do not offer me details just yet as to true demographics of both the speakers and the listeners.

3.  If you do not have services for me do you have suggestions?

4.  Do you have a few students we can set up an internship with us who can assist my non-profit with editing assistance... it is very hard for one person to keep up with our growth and cannot afford much money if any as we are only a donation type ministry.

Thank you for the survey.

"Re: your podcast summary","

Thank you for analyzing my podcast.  The goal of the show is to bring a mix of men and women, age demographic is 27-50 from different ethnic backgrounds and highlighting their works from independent film, music, literature in the horror genre and subgenres. 


Go back and analyze from 2022-current. There's a range of international guests from the UK to Sweden. 

And there's no team, it's only me Keeshia Lacy as the creator, editor and marketing The Random Horror Show.

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi –

 

I’m not sure why I received this email. Because I am a Penn alum? (If so, it might be good to say that in your message.)

I don’t understand why you would offer this lookback for free (might be good to say why). I invite my guests with some care, so I don’t know what your lookback would do for me.

And I don’t know where you get your data, but it isn’t accurate: too many guests and too few episodes in the last year.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Respectfully I don't know where you're getting your data. After 225 episodes we put SPeaking to Influence on indefinite hiatus in October as we pursued other opportunities. There have been no guests or new episodes under that label. That's disappointing coming from Wharton.

Hello – 

 

I recently received an opportunity to do a 2-month look back and was provided a list of potential guests. First, thank you – this was incredibly valuable. Second, how do individual get on the potential guests list? How was my podcast selected? 

 

I appreciate the 2-month look back, and I am interested in learning how I may be able to be added to your potential guests list.

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi – I’m curious about the driver behind this technology – like, why? The show you’re using for your insights in our case isn’t really the right kind of show – documentary series isn’t an interview show. I could however, see some merit in the analytics you’re offering for some podcasts, but I think you’ve created a solution where there isn’t a real problem for creators. 

 

It’s a blunt tool as of now, offered to a group of potential users that have bigger problems attracting their focus. 

 

Still, you have some AI tech here that could be made more useful if you targeted specific use cases and understood the industry better. And if you did that, you’d have some valuable IP. Which makes me wonder why it’s free – or is it just free for now?

 

Anyway – there’s something interesting here. If you have more to share about why and what you’re aiming to achieve, I’d like to know more.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you for the invitation. I completed the lookback exercise, and to be frank, I was disappointed in the process and the results. Despite your website claims that you would ""analyze your complete guest history to reveal patterns in guests’ professional backgrounds, areas of expertise, and industry representation, helping you understand your show’s current positioning and identify strategic opportunities,"" and that you would ""compile comprehensive reports showing your show’s evolution in terms of episode frequency, guest selection, topic coverage, and content delivery, enabling data-backed decisions for future growth,"" the questions and results were solely focused on age, race, and gender. Furthermore, despite the fact that most episodes of Local Pulse have more than one guest, I was only able to ""categorize"" one guest per episode. Necessarily, that means that the (less comprehensive than promised results) I received after completing the exercise were not even accurate.

I'm not sure what the goal of your project is, but it seems to me that it's something other than what is expressed at https://oid.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast-analytics/

Thank you for reaching out and considering Leadmore podcast. We'd like to participate in the lookback but for some reason it says that the link has expired. Can you share us a new link instead? Thank you!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","A few questions about this—

1- It seems like the stats you've already shared are wrong… we've released more episodes, more guests, and more audio hours…. Where are you finding those details?

2- What are the benefits for your team in doing this work? What are the benefits for us?


Thanks-

"Analytics Report","Hello,  
My name is Ruby Jones and I am the creator of Spectrum Talk with Ruby. I’ve just completed the Wharton Podcast Analytics survey I received, and appreciate being contacted. I am following up to inquire about the list of industry professionals compiled at the end of the survey. I would like to be included on this list as an entrepreneur, author, underrepresented minority voice, female voice and media professional. I would love to assist other podcasters in their goals by being featured. Is this possible? 

Thanks, 
Ruby Jones

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thanks for your email, but your analytics are way off. I post a weekly podcast, so in 6 months that is 24 episodes. You can check in ot Apple, Spotify, and others. I rarely have guests, and none in the current six months. My podcast averages 3 minutes. So in 6 months that's 1.2 hours.

Thanks for contacting me, but no thanks for now.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Your analytics are wrong.  

We put out six shows a week and do NOT have guests on most of our shows.  

We also have way more than six hours of audio released in the past month.  It’s at least double that. 

I’d this is an example of how you tabulate insights, we’re not interested.

So interesting to receive this, because we did such an audit last year, and taped more diverse topics/genders/professions, etc. in the fall - those will begin airing now. We also are taping 10 more episodes on Monday which will air in the summer and again will really diversify our lineup.

I look forward to receiving your next assessment!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello and thank you for reaching out – 

 

I appreciate the offer but feel it only fair to inform you that there is no magic formula for episode generation on my podcast. 

 

Nor is there a team. It’s my wife and I. 

 

I simply reach out to folks that I find interesting – lots of folks in fact from many walks of life – and the few who respond wind up on the show in nearly all cases. 

 

I am happy to have my 20th episode lined up and hope that with time – and more listeners – I may get the show on more folks radars. 

 

Not entirely sure what you folks offer at this point – but I’m game to chat and learn what I might be doing better. 

 

Be well and cheers – mark w

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi, 

Thanks for the email. I'm uninterested in what you offer at this time, primarily because of the following:
1) I don't know what's in it for you. Why is your non-profit doing this? Do you keep the information I provide to help you do your own research? An ""About"" page on your website would be helpful to provide some insight into this. 
2) I don't see the value in the analytics you offer. This might be different for other podcasts. I don't care about the age of my guests. I care about whether my guests have demonstrable and credible knowledge gained from experience or training. I care that my guests are approachable and are able to speak openly and genuinely about their knowledge areas.

Analytics that would be helpful to me is learning:
1) How people find my show 
2) What keeps people listening (or not)
3) More information about my audience. 

Good luck on this endeavor!
Yvonne

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you for sending me a link to ask about the race of my guests.

I appreciate that names like Wharton are going to debase themselves at the altar of racial identity and narrow their focus to immutable characteristics which have nothing to do with the content of character or the quality of information someone might bring to an audience. 

Please consider studying your racists surveys and trying to be LESS racist if you are receiving in federal funding for your ""podcast analytics"" work.

Thanks,
A Tax Payer, Podcaster, and non-racist

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","You’ve given me no reason as to the benefits to me of a lookback or why you’re wasting your time analyzing something without providing me a clear goal.

Honestly, do they even teach you how to do business over there or is it still archaic theory and ""cold calls"" with poor customer service?

Nobody cares what you did or who you are…we care about the results you can get us and the results you’ve gotten for others. And you do that by asking me questions, not by making statements.

You can work for me for free as an internship so you can actually learn business or you can trash my contact and never contact me again.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Frankly, the original email you sent out is misleading. It shows at least one graph, and suggest you are aggregating data from multiple sources. Instead, you are merely compiling a few stats that are not even representative of the body of work. Frankly, the ""recommendations"" are trivial and offer no value.

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","While we appreciate the offer, however, appears as if your analysis is incorrect. We have over 4 seasons, currently in our 5th. There have been many more guests and episodes. This seems as if your data collecting tools must not be very thorough. As such, we will not need any services at this time.

 

Thanks, and good luck.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi! There seems to be something wrong with whatever software you’re using for these tabulations, as my cohost and I put out 45+ episodes totaling 40+ hours within the past year, and only had 6 guests in that time. Might be worth looking into! But no, we’re not interested in this offer. Thanks!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi there,

I just wanted to follow up and let you know that your auto-tabulated numbers are off. We didn't have 15 guests in the past 9 episodes. Not sure when the past ""2 months"" is calculated at, but over the past 9 episodes, we've had 7 guests.

I'm not at all sure what the value of doing the free personalized lookback is, so we're going to pass at this time.

Thanks,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello Wharton Podast Analytics Team,

Thank you so much for your email. It’s very good to read about your work. We are certainly interested in being a part of it. But I have a question about your analytics which finds that we have put out 11 episodes in the past six months. Where did you draw that information from? I’m ashamed to say that we haven’t put out a single episode in the past six months: we’ve been busy on other projects. (New episodes are coming soon!)

We’d love to hear more. I’m happy to chat on the phone if that is preferable. 

Best wishes,

Patrick Cox

I am interested in this and clicked on the link earlier but got busy at my day job.  I circled back to the link and it timed out.  Is there a way I can still do the form? I am interested in what you all do.

For context I am Nyce and 1 of the cohosts of the podcast.  I am also a Doctoral student at University of Pittsburgh and I actually applied to Penn in the past.

Please let me know what the next steps are and I would love to connect further.

Earlier today I completed the look back. I never received an email with 
the analytics garnered from the look back, and can not find links to the 
suggested guests. Could you send both please?

"Podcast Producer Intro | Deep Specialization Podcast","Hi Wharton,

I received an email for my client's show Corey Quinn on the Deep Specialization podcast, and wanted to connect further with you. 

Is this currently a research study you are conducting with students?

I would love to learn more about this initiative, program, and the people behind it. 

Thanks!

	Thank you for considering the Rachel Unpacked podcast for this opportunity to analyze the episodes.

	I will personally go in and explore the links you have provided, further. 

	In the meantime, know that in 2024 the show was mostly a solo cast, where as this year the guests I have coming on are absolutely phenomenal female founders many of which are 7 and 8 figure entrepreneurs. To analyze guest interviews for your look-back, 2023 I interviewed a female billionaire founder, and several 7 and 8 figure female founders.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you so much.  This was a very interesting exercise.  One thing I noticed is that with the recommended lists of potential guests, there are no parenting experts or others who actively speak in fields related to parents and family which is my primary interest and that of my audience..  It occurs to me that the review that you had me participate in didn't seem to look at the content of the episodes or topics covered, but merely on demographics.  I very much appreciate the analysis and feedback, but I was just curious about the objective of the work you are doing.

	Is there a big podcast presence at the school? I've been working in podcasting since 2017 (I write a podcast recommendation newsletter, host a bunch of shows about the industry, work for a production company,...etc) and am always interested when higher ed gets involved.

	Hi there, 

	Thanks so much for reaching out. I am definitely interested in hearing more about this program and the value it brings. Do you have any examples of past lookbacks and their benefits? And I’m also curious about the data security of this endeavour - what will you be doing with the data you collect from us? 

	Looking forward to hearing from you, 

	Shannon

	Hello!  

	I don't quite understand this email. The tabulated information on us is completely wrong, we have close to 600 podcast episodes on YouTube, not 10. 
	I'm happy to learn more about this, but everything so far has been inaccurate. Can you tell me a little more about what this is?

"Small Independent Queer Podcast Collective","Good afternoon, Wharton Podcast Analytics Team!

I received a message to complete a loopback you all created for my podcast, Are You My Mother? I was so excited to learn more about what your team offers, and I’m very excited that there is a center at Penn helping podcasters refine their craft.

Are You My Mother? is one of about a dozen podcasts that are hosted by queer-identified folks who speak about media with the lens of that identity which operate independently and collectively as the Glitterjaw Queer Podcast Collective (glitterjaw.com).

If there would be anything that you all could offer us from an analytics perspective, I’d love to share that with the rest of the group. We really only use analytics tools built into our hosting platforms, and everyone in the Collective would appreciate knowing what our reach is and maybe what we could do to get connected with more audiences.

If you have any questions or can let me know what I can share out with our Collective, please feel free to follow-up to his email.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear WPA
Thank you for your email. I am currently extremely busy with work so need to take some time for your offer. 

I’m a little unclear what the ‘year in review’ with give me? You mention an analysis of my guests? What statistics/analytics will you be referring to? 

Thank you
Dani

We get so many emails from people trying to sell us a product or use our data I assumed you may have had another angle. 

Recruiting great guests is probably the #1 pain point for my team because of the amount of time it takes to not only find great people but also do the background research, connect with them, and book them. It’s a ton of work! Thanks for engaging in solving the problem. 👍👊

Hi Dallas,

 

We wanted to provide a free personalized lookback that aggregates your past episodes into several pages for you to analyze. Our primary goal is to help podcasters' guest recruitment efforts.

 

Thank you for spending time on it and your feedback is helpful as we continue to refine our efforts!

Subject: Question about Podcast Analytics 

 

Hello Warton Team, 

If you don’t mind me asking, I took a survey and reviewed the results after completing it. It seemed a bit elementary for Wharton. I could have dropped that data into an Excel spreadsheet and spent the same amount of time getting the same or more results. I think your recommendations were OK. There may have been 10% of the people you recommended that might fit the show. However, just putting their LinkedIn profile on a page seemed strange. Did they approach you to advertise or recommend them? Did you have an algorithm that found and put random names on that list? Is the list the same for all podcasts?


What is your goal? Is this a study that you are looking at other aspects of our responses without telling us? Why would you recommend guests to my podcast? What is your angle?

 

I realize I asked you a lot of questions, but I am genuinely curious about what you are trying to accomplish.


Enjoy the week,

Dallas

Thanks so much for reaching out. I am definitely interested in hearing more about this program and the value it brings. Do you have any examples of past lookbacks and their benefits? And I’m also curious about the data security of this endeavour - what will you be doing with the data you collect from us? 

Looking forward to hearing from you,

It is a great recap and we are ecstatic to see how far we've come. We have more episodes to edit as well, so it'd be nice to track again by mid year.

Good morning, 

 

I received this very legitimate-looking email from your team that looks too good to be true. Are you really offering a free analysis of my podcast or is there a pretty sophisticated scam out there using Wharton’s good name to gain credibility?

	Thank you for reaching out. I intend to complete the survey. However, although I did not submit the survey, when I click on the link, it says “You have either already completed the survey or your session has expired”. Is it possible for you to re-send the survey so that I can view and submit again?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey! This sounds awesome!


Is there a person behind this that I could have a chat with? 

This podcast is associated with Weaviate, an Agentic Database company. 
We are using AI Agents in all sorts of interesting ways for the podcast, and I think we could combine our strengths to create an awesome research report.

Hopefully interesting, super excited about the prospect of this!

"Re: your podcast summary","Thank you for reaching out. This sounds like an interesting effort. Users would benefit from a little more information and context. I’m hoping you’re not a scam!

I confess I am a little mystified by your efforts. The data analysis you offer is easily created on my own — and the lis of recommendations are entirely without context. Are these guests you have assessed for their appropriateness given my topic, typical content or editorial philosophy? Are they clients whom you are helping to place? Are they simply popular people on the podcast circuit, in which case they are of less interest to me anyway?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello, and thanks for reaching out. How in god's creation did you find us? We are a tiny nonprofit in Northern California with less than 100 downloads!! We could use all the help we can get. Our biggest challenge is the fact that we are hyper-local--although we do have nationally-recognized highly-talented guests with the topic of community being more important than ever. Much of what we do here could be modeled for other nonprofit community centers around the country. We appreciate any help you can offer.

I was just forwarded an email from your team regarding the People-ing with Purpose podcast from one of the hosts, Mary Beth Meadows. My name is David Robinson, and I’m the podcast producer working on that show.

 

I’d like to learn more about your team and your analytics. What sort of insights do you look for in podcasts? Also, could you tell me more about your department and the research associated with it?

 

My team develops a few B2B podcasts and am trying to grow this department, so I’m interested in learning more about what your team.

This seems interesting to me with the caveat that I have a very niche-y podcast and it's nothing more than a passion project/side hustle for me.

Interested to learn more about what this might entail.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast analytics team,
Many thanks for offer to allow me to complete the free personalized lookback created for me by your Wharton / University of Pennsylvania non-profit.
I was excited to complete the contribute but when I clicked the link I received the message that I have already submitted the form! I haven't. This may be because I started the process on my 'phone but then switched to my laptop.
Either way, I would love to benefit from the insights you are offering, so please can you send me a link that will allow me to do that.
Thankyou for reaching out.
Best wishes,
Barry.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","OK, for me it'll be really important to know who I'm dealing with and what exactly is a reason/agenda why you guys are doing it, so it's fine if you don't want to interview about it, but I wouldn't be able to participate without.

 
Maybe you can tell me what is in a ""two month lookback” because I don't really know how that would even help us

In order to know whether this would be helpful to me or not, what kinds of insights would I gain about my podcast guests? 

All of our guests are by invitation only, so I am not sure what information this analysis would reveal that we don't already know.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Thank you for reaching out. I intend to complete the survey. However, although I did not submit the survey, when I click on the link, it says “You have either already completed the survey or your session has expired”. Is it possible for you to re-send the survey so that I can view and submit again?

Thank you for your help.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello! 

I don't quite understand this email. The tabulated information on us is completely wrong, we have close to 600 podcast episodes on YouTube, not 10. 
I'm happy to learn more about this, but everything so far has been inaccurate. Can you tell me a little more about what this is? 

Thanks,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello!

I just finished the survey for your 6-month summary. This is pretty cool. I would like to point out that there is much more to diversity than just race, age and gender. We purposefully have guests join us from different countries around the world, from different business industries, from companies of various sizes, and guests with expertise across a wide range of topics. If you look at only the data from the little survey we filled out, you may get the false impression that our podcast is just white people talking about company culture, but there is an exceptional breadth of diversity in our guests- with many different languages and cultural backgrounds being represented. 

Thanks!

Matt

"No Small Endeavor","Hello, 
    My name is Jakob Lewis. I'm the executive producer of No Small Endeavor—a public radio show and podcast from PRX, Great Feeling Studios, and Tokens Media. I just filled out the 1-month lookback. I'm curious to learn more about what you can provide us. I also wanted to mention that as a weekly public radio we have to put out a new show every week. This means that we have reruns (we call them best ofs) throughout the year. Many of the episodes in this 1-month lookback happened to be reruns, so I did answer that those guests had been a guest before. We also released both an abridged version and unabridged version of each episode. These two factors are important in understanding our data. We are currently in the midst of a big booking initiative so I'd love to learn more soon. Thanks for reaching out and eager to hear back from you.

	Thank you much for your response. I have reviewed the results and selected a few recommendations. 

	Question - on the recommended people under the different categories, can you share the methodology to select those people? And, am I listed in any of your recommendations? In addition to being grateful, I am just interested in how unExpectedly Successful was selected as part of this work.

I’m trying to complete the lookback and getting a message that the session expired. I did start this morning and thought I could complete it later.

Can you send a new link or help me to complete it?

	My name is Rita, and I'm the producer of Stacy's podcast. Stacy forward me your email, and we would love to take part or your lookback.

	I'm getting an error when I try to complete the form, it's telling me it's either been completed or my session has expired. I believe the latter although I'm still not able to access it even when I refresh the page. Could you perhaps send me a new link?

	I look forward to hearing from you.

I tried accessing the survey link, but it appears to have expired. Would you be able to resend it?

Also, would it be okay if I create a social media post about Present Potential being recognized by The Wharton Podcast Analytics Team?

	Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,
	
	Thank you for reaching out and for recognizing Present Potential! It’s incredible to hear that your team has taken an interest in the podcast.
	
	I’d love to participate in the personalized lookback you’ve created. Present Potential is a project that I’ve been building solo, so I’m always looking for ways to gain insights and improve. Your analysis sounds like a valuable opportunity to reflect on the past few months and set meaningful goals for the future.
	
	I’ll review the lookback and complete it soon. Let me know if there’s anything else I should keep in mind, and I appreciate the opportunity to collaborate with Wharton’s Podcast Analytics Team.
	
	Looking forward to staying in touch!
	

	Regards,
	Hassan

We are helping to organize a sustained effort to pressure Congressman Crank into standing up and fighting for, not only his constituents, but the Constitution as a whole.

It will not be an easy or quick message to get across. The reality is that Crank has already decided to fall in-line against his constituents desires. He is co-sponsoring a national abortion bill, and one to dismantle the Dept of Education. He's also been silent (complicit) on the government/military cuts that have been sweeping through our communities. He will parrot the line about reducing deficit, but don't forget that we are at a $34T deficit because we stopped making the corporations pay their fair-share back in the 80's. The solution isn't to give them more breaks. ($4.5T is the next round of government handouts for our oligarchic class.)

I would like to have a handful of vets join me, and Indivisible, at Crank's office this coming Friday. You will go in and lodge a complaint and hopefully speak to an office representative. Last week, about 8 of us went and spoke to Crank's representative. Again, this isn't gonna change a thing, until we do it again....and again....and again!

See below for a flyer for the Indivisible Protest this Friday. 

See you there! //AG

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton team, 

 

I completed the survey to give you more demographic stats on my guests and saw that you link to other people afterwards. 

 

We usually run paid episodes but I’m open to having some of those guests you recommend on the program. I’m guessing they’re alumni?

 

Hope to hear from you soon.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi guys,

Some feedback:

I did the test and the data won't change how I select my guests. I don't care what race or gender they are, I select them based on merit - how interesting and knowledgeable they are.

Kind regards,
Simon

"How you can buy gold & silver today...","
Buy And Store Your Own Gold & Silver!

 	 

Stability.

Wealth Protection.

Long Term Financial Growth.

This is what many Americans are searching for when they purchase precious metals like gold and silver.

But what’s the best way to buy these precious metals?

Do you buy an ETF (Exchange Traded Fund), or do you get your hands on the real thing?

Here’s the thing about ETFs…

 <https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/pub/bfra/pzentc96/nv7/aii/b8n/Gray-X.png> 

You don’t actually own the gold or silver.

 <https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/pub/bfra/pzentc96/nv7/aii/b8n/Gray-X.png> 

You can’t take physical delivery of the metal.

 <https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/pub/bfra/pzentc96/nv7/aii/b8n/Gray-X.png> 

Taxes and fees can eat away at your gains.

 <https://d15k2d11r6t6rl.cloudfront.net/pub/bfra/pzentc96/nv7/aii/b8n/Gray-X.png> 

Shares may or may not have sufficient gold or silver backing.

But with physical gold or silver, you are the one in the driver’s seat. You have the control you’re looking for with your hard earned money. 

Here are the top 5 reasons why you should own physical gold and silver…

1.	Immediate Access
	Being able to open your safe and put your hands on the physical gold and silver coins you own brings reassurance to many gold and silver owners.
2.	Complete control
	You can stick it under your mattress, hide it in a wall, store it in a safe, bury it in your backyard or put it in a bank safe deposit box.
3.	Easy Portability
	If you think there’s ever a potential situation in which you may have to leave your house at short notice, you’ll want personal possession of your metals.
4.	Convenient Flexibility
	Taking physical possession of gold and silver is just one more tool in the toolbox, one more way to diversify your retirement savings.
5.	No Pricey Fees
	With ETFs and other forms of owning precious metals, you are forced to deal with fund managers, exchanges, custodial storage, and even sales of fund assets that can carry pesky fees that add up over time.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello, 

Thanks for reaching out.  Can you tell me a little more about what the value is for us to participate? The stats you shared are not useful to us, but we are open to learning what you offer. We do have over 120 episodes recorded and we have no problem finding guests in our category. We are looking for ways to reach a larger audience and new ways for them to engage with the large volume of content we have created over the past two years. 

We also like to speak with people, so please introduce yourself. If you are an AI, let us know. 

Thanks! 

Best, 
Erum

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thanks for this, and I'd love to learn more. On Mac Geek Gab, though, we rarely have guests. It's the same group of 3 co-hosts every episode, so I'm not sure if the system is working right?

I do have another show, Gig Gab for Working Musicians, that has guests regularly, so perhaps that would be more fun to use?

Thank you for reaching out. We are more interested in optimizing our other podcast titled Lightbulb Moments, as that is a live-interview style program, whereas Ideas in Action publishes recordings from events.

Thank you for the opportunity.

I’m trying to complete the lookback and getting a message that the session expired. I did start this morning and thought I could complete it later.

Can you send a new link or help me to complete it?

"Re: your podcast summary","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,




Thank you for including Productivity Smarts in your analysis and for providing these insightful guest metrics. I appreciate the opportunity to review our podcast lineup and explore ways to further diversify our guest pool.




I’m particularly interested in learning the best practices for reaching out to the guests you’ve recommended. Could you share any strategies or resources that have been effective in securing these expert voices? Additionally, do you facilitate introductions, or is there a preferred approach you suggest for making initial contact?




Looking forward to your insights and next steps.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Great to see something like this pop up in my email, and it actually appears to be legit.

Although I appreciate it, if I am being completely honest, the questions and associated stats it makes aren’t really helpful. Unless this is just a clever data collection ploy to get to give you more data on my guests, I’m not sure I understand the value it attempts to provide? Also, if we have 2 hosts and 9 episodes with only one guest per episode, there isn’t any way we could have hosted 26 guests….

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you!
As an alum of U of P I appreciate your innovation!
What you do is interesting- I'm not sure what your business model is? But I appreciate the breakdown! (Luckily I do strive to have non-white guests and that month did not happen to have any - also, I have a ton of female guest so that wasn't too representative either...[but with voter 1,000 shows by now, it all evens out over time!]

Also, when you offer to get more international guests, there was no question about whether the guests I have the month were in the US or not - 

thanks again

"Podcast analysis of Your Spiritual Journey with Bob Dove","Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Yesterday I completed your 20-episode analytics survey which asked questions about 4 measures: age, gender, race and whether the guest was from the U.S. or international. I understand the need for a diversity measure and appreciated the subsequent lists of potential guests for future podcasts, however I have a few questions:

1. Do the people whose names are on the lists of potential guests know that they are on these lists and how did you determine what names made those lists?
2. I have more than 110 weekly episodes and the last 20 do not provide an accurate picture of the overall diversity of representation of the full body of work. The diversity I focus on is one of religious and spiritual background, as well as country. I do take into account gender and age.
3. Given your mission, can you create a survey and subsequent report for me that would take into account these other factors?

Regards,
Bob Dove, PhD

"Invitation from Wharton","  

	Thank you for the invitation.  However, I would appreciate more details/information.  This is a time-consuming request. 

1.	How will you determine what my future goals should be without talking to me directly to understand what my current goals are?
2.	Explain how you determine that your ""goals"" will benefit my podcast?
3.	How am I to determine a ""Classification"" for my guests?  Each guest is selected based on the specific information/experiences they can share from their jobs, activities to address PR issues: crisis communications, AI & PR matters, digital enhancements and more.
4.	 What are the overall insights/benefits my podcast will derive from your assessments that are not available to me via podcast data I get from APPLE, Buzzsprout, Spotify, etc.

"RE: Question about Podcast Analytics","One of your recommendations was Tony Lucca. If my team reaches out to Tony and says, “Hey Tony, Wharton Podcast Analytics recommended we have you on the show, "" will Tony say, “Thanks. I have been working with Wharton’s Get More Podcast Bookings Analytics Team.” Or will Tony say, “What the heck are you talking about?”

Is the list you generate a curated list from people you know who want to be on more podcasts, or is it a random list that AI has scoured the web and come back with that matches profile characteristics? This information will be helpful to know if we reached out to any of your suggestions. 

 

Thanks,


Dallas

Oh… well, thanks!😊

 

We get so many emails from people trying to sell us a product or use our data I assumed you may have had another angle. 

Recruiting great guests is probably the #1 pain point for my team because of the amount of time it takes to not only find great people but also do the background research, connect with them, and book them. It’s a ton of work! Thanks for engaging in solving the problem. 👍👊

Hi Dallas,

 

We wanted to provide a free personalized lookback that aggregates your past episodes into several pages for you to analyze. Our primary goal is to help podcasters' guest recruitment efforts.

 

Thank you for spending time on it and your feedback is helpful as we continue to refine our efforts!

Subject: Question about Podcast Analytics 

 

Hello Warton Team, 

If you don’t mind me asking, I took a survey and reviewed the results after completing it. It seemed a bit elementary for Wharton. I could have dropped that data into an Excel spreadsheet and spent the same amount of time getting the same or more results. I think your recommendations were OK. There may have been 10% of the people you recommended that might fit the show. However, just putting their LinkedIn profile on a page seemed strange. Did they approach you to advertise or recommend them? Did you have an algorithm that found and put random names on that list? Is the list the same for all podcasts?


What is your goal? Is this a study that you are looking at other aspects of our responses without telling us? Why would you recommend guests to my podcast? What is your angle?

 

I realize I asked you a lot of questions, but I am genuinely curious about what you are trying to accomplish.


Enjoy the week,

Dallas

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you for that. Very insightful!

I have a question: how can we get Mike Handcock and Landi Jac on the list? And what determined the placement?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Thanks for reaching out. I took a brief look at the questionnaire.

Before I fill this out, I'd like to know how you would like us to proceed re: classification. The questions presented pertain to guests. The first episode on the questionnaire did, technically, include guests, but they were more like co-hosts.

For clarification: The podcast is for Graper Harper Cosmetic Surgery in Charlotte, NC. It's hosted by the three doctors at the practice.

The episode in question had two skincare professionals from the practice join the doctors. We do have actual guests from time to time, meaning people from outside of the practice. To keep your work as close to scientific as possible, I wanted to make sure we're talking about the same things when addressing classification of guests.

Would these types of individuals count as guests, or would you consider them co-hosts for those specific episodes in which other professionals from the practice appear?

Thanks, and I look forward to your feedback.

My best,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you for your email.

I have a few questions before accepting:

1. Can you do 12 months instead of 6?
2. Will you be including shorts?

3. You say your team provides  ""free support to podcast creators by sharing and automating analyses of their shows”. Who do you share it with? And is the analysis automated?
4. Is there a person I can communicate with. I found no names on your website.


Thank you,
Jane

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you.

LIterally two minutes spent looking at my podcast episodes would clarify for you that I don't interview guests.  (I do have some very awesome guest readers playing a couple of roles in these fictional stories once in a while; I recommend those episodes over the ones that are just me.)

Where do you see that I have ""hosted 15 guests?""  In fact there are exactly five people who have donated their great talents to a couple of the stories here and there, for which I am very grateful.  Where do you see ""9 episodes"" in the last three months? (They are weekly; that's 12 or 13 episodes.)

I find myself truly fascinated.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thanks for your note.  

I appreciate the information, but I'm not entirely clear on the value proposition.  I'm well aware the guest list from my podcast, and there must be some error in your count, because I have only one guest per episode.  I have audience analytics through Libsyn, but I'm definitely interested in ideas for further promotion of the podcast, if that's the sort of thing you can do.

And I would appreciate knowing more about your organization. Is it a separate non-profit, or part of the OID department? And who are your staff — is it Wharton students, Wharton staff, or third parties?   It sounds like a great initiative.

		Good morning!  

		Thank you so much for reaching out regarding this opportunity and the show These Are Questions. Would definitely be interested in being a part of this study and analysis to use for the foundation and future course studies.

		Im actually currently filming season 8 of the show and preparing to release episodes in early March. Would  you like me to complete the study now or as Season Eight beings to air. 

		I'm open to insight and even a interview perspective if you would like to learn more about the intention of the show when it first came out.

		Thank you again and have a great rest of your morning!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team,

Thank you for your email and the information you've provided.

We have completed one season of our HealthTech Growth podcast and are about to launch our second. At this early stage, we don't see data analysis as a priority.

However, our CEO, Sabrina, hosts another podcast called Provider's Edge that have published more than 250 episodes. She may be interested in a lookback for that podcast. If you would like to conduct a review for Provider's Edge, please share the relevant link with us. 

Sending positive vibes,

Instead of taking action to stop Israel's genocidal ambitions, however, lawmakers in Canada are trying to silence any debate about it.

As we argue, Déry's interventions are not about ensuring safe campuses, but about silencing Palestinian perspectives amid a genocide.

“Minister Déry’s actions are a direct attack on academic freedom and an alarming escalation of political interference in higher education,” said CJPME Acting President Michael Bueckert. “Her attempts to police discussion on Palestine and dictate the boundaries of academic inquiry are unacceptable in a democratic society. Anything short of resignation represents an ongoing threat to academic freedom in Quebec.”

On January 6th, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced that he is resigning, triggering a Liberal Party leadership race. The next leader will become Prime Minister and lead the party into the next general election, which will likely follow shortly after. This provides a rare opportunity for party supporters to push for a leader who will take a stronger position on Palestinian human rights. Stay tuned for next week, when CJPME will publish an analysis of the candidates on the issue of Palestinian rights.

CJPME previously let supporters know that registering as a Liberal Party member would allow them to vote in this contest. Now that registration is closed, those who registered must verify their identity and cast their ballot. Once verified, you can vote between February 26 at 8AM ET and March 9 at 3PM ET.

Encouragés par Trump, les dirigeants israéliens se font de plus en plus entendre pour appeler à « vider Gaza de ses habitants <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.cjpme.org/r?u=DzMAZoTFUqVJJ-pE33tjdTf6bB7x_IjE2vrlWmrPlCrGyHn7TP71H4XyaaNQimnsvOafmhRGRTx88qt5Rwbz1saBdp6bZqWqwm5nDE67LuTWwmYSelzq0KT27AbKOv7BLPXOd-063NO7AjHcP1VRQA&e=318759452ce1b3b5019c867c9f13c9e3&utm_source=cjpme&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=em_2025_02_28_demos&n=63__;!!IBzWLUs!SZg278ztGBgDGJ0CeQDIG5UUyEe8krmwonTPfoR5BQ1Dr95Rd43JLkOY0ZEqoRCC9OrLENzgwpciME8nabryvLAfy7g$>  ».

Cependant, au lieu de prendre des mesures pour mettre fin aux ambitions génocidaires d'Israël, les législateurs canadiens tentent de faire taire tout débat à ce sujet. Cette semaine, CJPMO a demandé la démission <https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://fr-cjpme.nationbuilder.com/pr_2025_02_27_resignation_of_quebec_higher_education_minister?e=318759452ce1b3b5019c867c9f13c9e3&utm_source=cjpme&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=em_2025_02_28_demos&n=66__;!!IBzWLUs!SZg278ztGBgDGJ0CeQDIG5UUyEe8krmwonTPfoR5BQ1Dr95Rd43JLkOY0ZEqoRCC9OrLENzgwpciME8nabry4EoXVQY$>  de la ministre de l'Enseignement supérieur du Québec, Pascale Déry, à la suite de ses tentatives répétées pour étouffer la liberté académique et faire taire les discussions critiques sur la Palestine. Comme nous le soutenons, les interventions de Mme Déry ne visent pas à assurer la sécurité des campus, mais à faire taire les perspectives palestiniennes dans un contexte de génocide.

Les Canadiens continueront de manifester à travers le pays pour soutenir les droits des Palestiniens.

« Les actions de la ministre Déry constituent une atteinte directe à la liberté académique et une escalade alarmante de l'ingérence politique dans l'enseignement supérieur », a déclaré le président par intérim de CJPMO, Michael Bueckert. « Ses tentatives de contrôler le débat sur la Palestine et de dicter les limites de la recherche universitaire sont inacceptables dans une société démocratique. Tout ce qui ne va pas jusqu'à la démission représente une menace permanente pour la liberté académique au Québec. »

Le 6 janvier, le premier ministre Justin Trudeau a annoncé sa démission, déclenchant ainsi une course à la direction du Parti libéral. Le prochain chef deviendra premier ministre et dirigera le parti lors des prochaines élections générales, qui devraient avoir lieu peu après. C'est une occasion rare pour les partisans du parti de faire pression pour qu'un chef adopte une position plus ferme sur les droits de l'homme des Palestiniens. Restez à l'écoute la semaine prochaine, lorsque CJPMO publiera une analyse des candidats sur la question des droits des Palestiniens

Was this done with AI?  If so, you may want to rethink it.

I've never seen stats SO far off.

REMOVE me.  PERMANENTLY.

Anyone who sends this, will NEVER be a party I do business with.

Imagine yourself watching a beautiful agility run. Maybe it’s one of your classmates, your instructor, or a competitor you admire!

 

Have you ever wondered what makes an agility run look smooth and fast? How does all that happen while the team is also clearly having so much fun? 

 

The answer is a principle that is at the heart of the OneMind Dogs method: The 3 Cs

 

The 3 Cs stands for Connect, Commit, Cue. When you understand the 3 Cs and combine them with handling techniques, advancing on the course is easy! Check out this video to learn about the 3 Cs.

Understanding the 3 Cs will transform the sport of agility for you and your dog!  When you practice the 3 Cs between every obstacle, you’ll run clean every time, and more importantly, both you and your dog will have a blast doing it!

	Hello,  

	Thanks for reaching out.  Can you tell me a little more about what the value is for us to participate? The stats you shared are not useful to us, but we are open to learning what you offer. We do have over 120 episodes recorded and we have no problem finding guests in our category. We are looking for ways to reach a larger audience and new ways for them to engage with the large volume of content we have created over the past two years. 

	We also like to speak with people, so please introduce yourself. If you are an AI, let us know. 

	Thanks! 

	Best, 
	Erum

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","It says I have already completed the survey. I did open it but it wasn't clear how long it would take to work through so I put it on hold for another time. Are you able to re release it? Also, why did you do this and how was I selected? Just curious. Thanks, Tanya

Thank you for reaching out. That is awesome. It says ""You have either already completed the survey or your session has expired."" I think i did click on it, so maybe that's why. I was wondering if I could get another link sent as I'd love to see your insights.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Can you reset this and resend it to me?  I checked it out yesterday and I waited for your reply. Now its saying my session has expired. I believe it just needs to be reset.

 

I will go through it again. How long will it take so I can set aside enough time to complete it in one sitting (otherwise it will expire again I assume).

 

Sorry, I didn’t realize it would expire like this.

"RE: Beyond Better with Stacy Ennis podcast analysis","Dear Wharton Podcast Analytics Team, 

My name is Rita, and I'm the producer of Stacy's podcast. Stacy forward me your email, and we would love to take part or your lookback.

I'm getting an error when I try to complete the form, it's telling me it's either been completed or my session has expired. I believe the latter although I'm still not able to access it even when I refresh the page. Could you perhaps send me a new link?

I look forward to hearing from you.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hey Wharton Team

Thanks for reaching out. I'm a prior alumni of Wharton and glad to be in touch. 

I'm in the process of turning down my prior podcast and rebranding under a new brand and concept. Would this still be useful as a process in that regard?

thanks so much!

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Whom can we contact to verify the authenticity of this email? 

 Although this appears to be an interesting deep dive regarding into the H + H podcast; it’s worth noting that there are a plethora of emails that appear legitimate but upon further investigation fall into the questionable category. 

We value our time and yours.

Kindly advise

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello again, 

I happen to be in a very busy season of my business right now, so while I do respect Wharton and the opportunity to gain insights about my podcast, I would need more information about what those insights are in order to make a decision about whether it would be of value to me, at this time.

	Hello, 

	In order to know whether this would be helpful to me or not, what kinds of insights would I gain about my podcast guests? 

	All of our guests are by invitation only, so I am not sure what information this analysis would reveal that we don't already know.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thank you. I completed it. 

I noticed that the episodes mentioned weren’t my guest episodes. However, the following may help lend to what you’re looking for. 

• 100% of my guests are female founders 
• The entrepreneurs are from various niches of business

• 99% of them are under 50 as I had 1 woman who’s a billionaire in her 60’s
• 100% are located within the U.S.

Hope that helps.

		Good morning,

		Thank you for considering the Rachel Unpacked podcast for this opportunity to analyze the episodes.

		I will personally go in and explore the links you have provided, further. 

		In the meantime, know that in 2024 the show was mostly a solo cast, where as this year the guests I have coming on are absolutely phenomenal female founders many of which are 7 and 8 figure entrepreneurs. To analyze guest interviews for your look-back, 2023 I interviewed a female billionaire founder, and several 7 and 8 figure female founders.

	Good morning!  

	Thank you so much for reaching out regarding this opportunity and the show These Are Questions. Would definitely be interested in being a part of this study and analysis to use for the foundation and future course studies.

	Im actually currently filming season 8 of the show and preparing to release episodes in early March. Would  you like me to complete the study now or as Season Eight beings to air. 

	I'm open to insight and even a interview perspective if you would like to learn more about the intention of the show when it first came out.

	Thank you again and have a great rest of your morning!

I clicked on the survey link to “check it out” and didn’t provide any answers.

"Podcast analytics","Jon,
Thanks for the invitation to have my podcast performance analyzed. I’m sure most people are excited to know how their podcast is performing and getting tips about how to improve their reach. This may be strange to hear, but I’m not one of them.

Since I’m retired, and doing this podcast for fun, I don’t pay attention to statistics. I created Story-Power to share my love of stories and nothing more. 

I did start the process of get a year in review report and then realized, it doesn’t matter to me. There must be others out there like me, and maybe that could be part of your program, not just examining the performance of podcasts, but finding out more about the intent of the podcast creator. I’m suggesting this as a former educator, however, I don’t know anything about your program, so this may not be a helpful suggestion.

I hope your program is successful,
Lucinda

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton Podcast Analytics team,

 

We hope you had a great weekend!

 

Thank you very much for reaching out to us. We just completed the analytics survey through your link provided below. This was great! Coincidentally, our company and studio are located just outside of Philadelphia. We think the work that you’re doing to could positively impact many people in the podcasting space. Would the Analytics Team potentially be interested in exploring collaboration opportunities? We’d be happy to help spread awareness of your team’s initiatives. Could be something very exciting here!

 

Please let us know if you have any questions or concerns.

 

Thank you,

"RE: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton PA

Before clicking on the link I shared your solicitation with some Bites colleagues, who agreed we’d like to participate. But when I clicked on the link in the email below I was told it had been used and/or expired. Thinking my sharing triggered that. Could you re-institute the link?

Thanks

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Sunaina, and I am writing on behalf of the Bangalore International Center. We recently received an email from your team containing information about the auto-tabulated summary statistics of our podcast over the last three months, along with a link to participate in the lookback.

Unfortunately, the link expired before we had the chance to view it. Would it be possible for you to provide us with a fresh link to access the summary statistics and participate in the lookback?

We look forward to your response and appreciate your assistance.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi Wharton Podcast Analytics Team, 

You might want to review the way your system auto-tabulates data. We have not had 35 guests. We have not had half that number including interviews that we recorded separately. 

Given how inaccurate this was, we are not interested in your services at this time. 

Thank you for your time,

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello,

Thank you.  This is appreciated, though I fear won't be a tool I expect to use long-term, as I am curtailing my podcasting in favor of Youtube.  This is mostly due to the anticipation of a decrease in interviews of about 50% as my targeted group is mostly European and my schedule no longer allows much time to connect with them.  However, life does surprise me on occasion.

Meanwhile, a brief fun fact: I used to work as a contractor for Penn Sports Network as part of the TV broadcast team for Penn sports until I ""retired"" about two years ago.  I live in Audubon, NJ.  Small world, eh!

I also founded the Jewish Culture and Holocaust 10.7 Remembrance Community on Facebook in 2020, and that Community has over 4,300 members. This is a very active Community with many Community posts daily and many conversations, likes, and direct messages happening daily. 

Now, I would like to know what you want from me and why you sent me the message. I am very interested in seeing how we can partner, but to be most candid, I do not have a budget for advertising, and I support all of the work out of my pocket.

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Thanks. Appreciate the exercise. It does turn out that 90% of the episodes you flagged were U.S.-based white males, something we are aware of. Generally, we are very deliberate in the guests we choose and try to represent a diverse range of voices, including internationally. The suggestions, which I reviewed, were not useful for us because our focus is on the life sciences. Let me know if you have any questions or further ideas.

			Hello,  

			Thanks for reaching out.  Can you tell me a little more about what the value is for us to participate? The stats you shared are not useful to us, but we are open to learning what you offer. We do have over 120 episodes recorded and we have no problem finding guests in our category. We are looking for ways to reach a larger audience and new ways for them to engage with the large volume of content we have created over the past two years. 

			We also like to speak with people, so please introduce yourself. If you are an AI, let us know. 

			Thanks! 

			Best, 
			Erum

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","This was garbage, please remove me from whatever list I got on. You just asked questions I could have easily applied to a spreadsheet and done a breakdown of all my episodes... by myself. This 'report' is from WHARTON?

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hello:

Thank you very much for your outreach and for the tabulation below. I am interested in participating in the lookback. 

That being said, can you tell me first what is the purpose of your project and what do you hope to get out of this? Additionally, after the look back, will you have any follow up steps or suggestions? I’m just curious about the point of your project and how it will help you and me.  I think your non-profit is interesting and can be important, I just don’t understand it’s goals.

Thanks for your time and attention.

I am pausing my podcast until further notice or I might put out an episode once a month so I have to decline your kind offer!

		Hello,  

		Thanks for reaching out.  Can you tell me a little more about what the value is for us to participate? The stats you shared are not useful to us, but we are open to learning what you offer. We do have over 120 episodes recorded and we have no problem finding guests in our category. We are looking for ways to reach a larger audience and new ways for them to engage with the large volume of content we have created over the past two years. 

		We also like to speak with people, so please introduce yourself. If you are an AI, let us know. 

		Thanks! 

		Best, 
		Erum

"Re: An Invitation from Wharton","Hi -- 
Thanks for getting back to me.
I appreciate the project's goals, but because of the increased recent targeting of LGBTQ+ figures, I'm reluctant to provide information about my guests without more transparency about who's running the project & a formal privacy policy.
Happy to take another look in the future if those elements are in place.
