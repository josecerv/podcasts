They can be solo episodes &/or interview current/potential clients/partners on preferred topics (we can provide intros to people of interest within our network). Record the episodes. We prepare the episodes & promote each one via our social channels & email list. Repurpose the content however preferred & promote. If agreed, we can set up an interview for our free podcast to let everyone know about the series & talk about everything you mentioned. We will promote on all of our platforms. If things work out then we can talk about a longer partnership.

I appreciate your support and enthusiasm for the Customer Success community. Just to clarify, on the podcast we only feature Customer Success leaders as guests — the focus is on sharing practical insights, real-life experiences, and best practices directly from CS professionals themselves. That being said, if you’re interested in exploring sponsorship opportunities or other ways to collaborate, I’d be happy to discuss how we can work together to bring value to our listeners. Let me know if you’d like to continue the conversation!

Due to the popularity and longevity of The Sales Podcast—11+ years and over 700 episodes—I've had to make some changes to handle the flood of pitches I receive. I will consider a swap with your recommended guest if they have a podcast or a trade with your company, i.e., I accept your client on The Sales Podcast, and you get me a placement on another show. Here is my speaker sheet. Wes Schaeffer Speaker Profile Wes Schaeffer Speaker Sheet.pdf https://hubs.ly/Q0390Hm80 Or I ask for a small retainer to offset the cost of production and promotion of your guest. Your guest's interview will appear on: Apple Podcasts Pandora Spotify iHeart Radio YouTube Music Which of the three options above is best for you?",1,"This reply shows interest. It engages with Latoya’s recommendation by offering specific options—including a paid retainer option—for having her guest appear on The Sales Podcast, and it asks which option works best for her, indicating a willingness to work together under certain conditions."

As a podcast host, it's important to me to only accept qualified individuals to be guests, which means I have to carefully vet each request. Your areas of expertise sound great, but there is nothing on your website or that you provided to me that would allow me to understand why you are qualified to speak about those topics (no articles you've written, prior guest appearances, etc) so I'm not able to adequately assess you as a guest. I know that it can be hard early on when trying to get your first guest appearance, which may not be your case and if so, I hope you'll send me examples from your prior work, but even if you record a few solo videos and put them on your website, where you can showcase your ability to present your thoughts on a given topic, it would go far in positioning you as a qualified expert.

To ensure each guest is a fit for our audience, as well as the tone/feel of our podcast, we ask for any interested party to fill out this form to be considered for a future show. It's not just about the resume and experience of each guest, but also the flow of conversation between Brett and the guest and how vulnerable they are willing to be with their information, stories, and tactical takeaways they provide to the audience. It also helps if they are somewhat familiar with the show themselves so we can ensure they truly understand the audience and the show's mission. We currently have our upcoming schedule set but we review guest submissions regularly. We'd be happy to consider your application once it is submitted. Enjoy your day, and thanks again for reaching out to us!

I genuinely appreciate you thinking of us. I wanted to take a moment to clarify the focus of our show. The Prison Officer Podcast maintains a very specific mission: to spotlight the experiences of those who have served as correctional officers - the men and women who know firsthand what it means to sit 16 hours in a Segregation Unit, eat meals off inmate trays, and handle the most challenging aspects of institutional life, including responding to violence, and inmate self-harm incidents. Our podcast was created specifically to give voice to these ""forgotten cops"" of our jails and prisons who often receive the leftover equipment, leftover training, and leftover respect within the criminal justice system. I've made a commitment to put their stories and experiences at the forefront. Based on your background, I don't believe our podcast would be the right platform for your expertise at this time. However, I'm always open to discussing this further if you feel there's an angle I've overlooked regarding your connection to correctional work. If you'd like to discuss this further, feel free to reach me directly at mike",0,"Explanation: The email explicitly states that, based on Latoya's background, the podcast wouldn’t be a suitable platform for her.

Message 2: From languageofthesoulpodcast@gmail.com on 2025-03-04 12:26",languageofthesoulpodcast@gmail.com,"Hello Latoya, We're thrilled to have you on board for the Language of the Soul Podcast. Your willingness to share your insights and stories with us—and, by extension, our listeners—promises to make for an enriching episode that aligns perfectly with our mission to delve deep into the cultural impact of storytelling. As partners in this journey, Dominick Domingo and I are eager to weave your unique perspectives into the fabric of our podcast. Since launching in November 2023, we've amassed over 50 insightful episodes, engaging audiences on all major podcast platforms, including Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, YouTube, IHeartRadio, and Buzzsprout, to name a few. Your voice is set to join a diverse chorus of storytellers who have captivated our listeners with their compelling narratives. For that reason, to let you know a bit about the spirit and intent of the podcast, here’s a brief description: LANGUAGE of the SOUL Podcast Based on Dominick Domingo’s acclaimed book by the same name, Language of the Soul Podcast explores the infinite ways in which life, simply put, is story. Individually, we’re all products of the stories we’ve been exposed to. Collectively, culture is the sum of its history. Our respective worldviews are little more than stories we tell about ourselves. Socialization is the amalgamation of narratives we weave about the human condition, shaping everything from the codes we live by to policy itself. Language of the Soul Podcast spotlights master storytellers in the Arts and Entertainment, from cinema to the literary realm. It explores topical social issues through the lens of narrative, with an eye on the march toward human potential. And as always, a nudge to embrace the power of story in our lives… Here's What Happens Next? Scheduling Your Episode: We're excited to find a time that fits your schedule for our conversation. Please choose a recording slot via our scheduling link: https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0_49qZE7cccMlxTT43LvGMx1FrapXTccZ54VIrRUETUmweQ-fM1aGofYva0fAkaDJlM-57pPG0?gv=true . Our recording sessions are conducted on Sundays between 11 AM and 6 PM PST, utilizing Zoom for an audio-only format to ensure comfort and flexibility. Getting to Know You Better: Understanding your journey and the stories you wish to share is crucial for a meaningful conversation. We kindly ask you to complete our brief guest questionnaire here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScj_A2ZT4uSRt37IAqRt0sTjiAo0fYKGd7z_I7hqqKpfc99IQ/viewform?usp=sf_link . This form is an opportunity to share your preferred bio, any links you'd like featured alongside your episode, and the topics or stories you're passionate about. Completing this form lets Dominick fully understand who you are as our guest. *Please note that if this form is not completed, we will need to cancel you as a guest. We do this because we want to put out good content and have you represented in the best light possible, and only you can do that by answering our questions as completely as possible . Preparing for the Recording: Before our recording session, we'll email you the final details, including the Zoom link, and address any queries you might have. This pre-session communication is the perfect opportunity to highlight specific themes or questions you'd like us to cover. Looking Ahead: Your contribution to the Language of the Soul Podcast is invaluable. It's not merely about sharing your narrative; it's about igniting inspiration and offering enlightenment through the compelling power of stories. We are dedicated to crafting an episode that not only showcases your unique contributions but also deeply resonates with our audience. We highly suggest listening to a few of our episodes before scheduling your appearance on our show. We eagerly anticipate you joining us to share your story with the world. In the meantime, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or require additional information.",1,"Reasoning: The email demonstrates clear interest in having Latoya on the podcast. It explicitly welcomes her as a guest, provides scheduling links, a guest questionnaire, and contact information for additional queries—all elements that indicate active engagement and a genuine invitation to participate on the show."

Always looking for someone that can bring a different perspective on doing business and add insight to what we are all trying to do out here as small business owners. The podcast is audio only, but I like to connect via Streamyard for the recording just so we have a visual connection, it just seems a little more personal. I will apologize ahead of time that you get to visually chat with an old dude that has a face for radio(even though we own a video production studio)🤣 The podcast is typically 30-45 minutes, sometimes longer, just depends on how well we can drive the conversation. All total it is about an hour to your time from login to completing the podcast and will focus on your background, how you got to where you are today, your business insights and then perhaps how you are giving back to the community if that is something that you do. If you are willing, I like to have just a quick Zoom call type of intro just so you can ask any question and get comfortable with how it will all happen. It is not live so there is no pressure and we are not under a time crunch so it is pretty casual, I like to have fun on the podcast and learn something along the way. If you would like to connect in the next week or so, let me know and we will set something up and go from there. Thanks again for reaching out and I hope to hear from you soon!!

It expresses honor at having Latoya on the show, explains the format and scheduling details, and invites her to a brief Zoom call to get comfortable before recording.

I hope you’ve had a chance to listen to a few episodes. Secondly, I appreciate you considering being a guest on the podcast. However, to help me focus on the theme of The Life Shift, I’d like to know if you’d be willing to share a pivotal moment in your life that changed everything. These moments are usually personal and significant. I prefer to get as specific as possible. My challenge with guests is to help them identify one specific moment in their lives that changed everything. For some, it’s a phone call, an email, or a diagnosis. I like to have a conversation centered around the moment the guest feels was most pivotal. When I first started The Life Shift Podcast , I thought my life shift was when my mom passed away when I was 8. However, after recording all these conversations, I’ve reflected and narrowed down the moment. My initial shift wasn’t when she died, but when my father had to sit me down and tell me the news. The specific words he uttered, “Your mom died in an accident” (or whatever he actually said), were the moment that truly shifted my life. It’s funny how listening to others’ stories helps us reflect more deeply on our own experiences. I recorded an episode about my journey, and you might want to listen to it first: https://",1,"This email reply clearly expresses interest in having Latoya as a guest. It gratefully acknowledges her outreach and then asks if she’d be willing to share a specific, pivotal moment from her life—a requirement tied to the show’s theme.

I would be honored to have you as a guest on my podcast!  I should probably double-check a couple of things just to manage expectations a bit.  My format on the podcast is somewhat ""rapid fire,"" meaning I try to keep the entire episode to around 15 minutes.  Also, I ask the same 5 questions of all the guests.  This gives my followers different perspectives on the same concept to consider.  If that sounds okay to you, then please go to teamengagementpodcast.com where you can review the questions I'm asking the guests this season.  There's also a calendar link at the bottom of the page where you can schedule a time. Would you mind connecting with me on LinkedIn?  I always like to connect with my guests on LinkedIn when possible.  Here's my profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shawnjrichards/ Oh, one other thing (again, just to manage expectations): I'm currently booked through this month, so the calendar will show times in April when we can record the podcast, and then it will be released some time in May.  I hope that timing works okay for you. Thanks Latoya!  I hope to have you on the podcast soon!  Have a great day!",1,"The reply expresses clear interest in having Latoya as a podcast guest. It includes scheduling details, provides links for more information, and even asks to connect on LinkedIn—none of which are rejection or deferral.

As you can imagine, I get requests daily from brilliant experts/influencers such as yourself (or their agents). I can't say yes to everyone. So to help me better discern if you're a good fit, please take a moment to fill out this short questionnaire that answers the questions I most need answered to consider you (or your client – it's best if the actual guest fills this out, and not an agent): https://forms.gle/k2fFFZNXqvtKFzWa7 If I do believe we're a great fit to create a wisdom conversation together that would be right for ""Bridging Connections,"" I'll surely reach back out to you. I look forward to learning more about you! Best, Bryan Reeves ================================================== Bryan Reeves Author, Relationship Coach, Mentor",1,"The reply includes a link to a questionnaire for Latoya to fill out, which is an application form to assess her fit as a guest.

Abrazo grande, Juan -- juan",1,"The reply expresses genuine interest in continuing the conversation rather than a rejection. Although Juan is temporarily away on paternity leave, he explicitly states, “me interesa mucho que no perdamos esta conversación” and provides clear instructions and contact information for his team members to address further inquiries—whether regarding his services or participation in events/conferences. Directing Latoya to members who handle bookings meets one of the key criteria for classifying as INTEREST."

We appreciate you taking the time to share your background with us. At this time, based on the information you provided, we don’t feel it’s the right fit for our audience. Here are the criteria we are looking for when Sharon interviews a guest on The Innovative Agency Podcast: Sharon is an attorney who helps marketing agencies protect their Intellectual Property, generate new streams of revenue from existing assets, and make sure that the 4 Critical Legal Documents are properly in place to mitigate unnecessary risks. The Innovative Agency Podcast exists to help marketing agency leaders answer the questions: “What’s Next?” How are agencies staying on the cutting edge of marketing trends? (Think AI, how agencies innovated a new process or IP to create growth, how the agency is creating new revenue streams, etc.) How are they adapting their businesses to meet new business challenges in the agency world? (Think changes in software or tools that allow for reaching customers in new ways, etc.) This is because each of these innovations also comes with legal considerations. The guest should use their expertise and stories of what they are doing from an innovation standpoint to showcase their smarts and capabilities while doing it in a way others can try to emulate. Sincerely, Lora Howdyshell Client Relationship Manager & Executive Assistant Toerek Law Office:",0,"The email reply clearly states that based on the information provided, they do not feel it’s the right fit for their audience.

Thank you for your interest in participating in the Sisters With Ventures podcast. Her podcast is typically slated for women investors or women who have experience in this area through other ventures. Below I have the crieteria for what we look for in our guests to get a better idea. What we look for in our Speakers : Accredited Investors or General Partners: You should be an accredited investor  who has invested as an angel or a general partner at a fund, with a passion for changing the status quo and a commitment to fostering diversity and inclusion within the venture capital ecosystem. Impactful Stories: We're looking for women who have overcome barriers, challenged norms, and have unique insights into the world of angel investing and venture capitalism. Commitment to Change: Our ideal speaker is someone actively working to create change, whether through educational initiatives, advocacy, or by leading by example in the investment world. Women of Color: We are committed to amplifying marginalized voices in the ecosystem. Wishing you the best in your endeavors.",0,"The reply does not express any concrete interest in moving forward with having Latoya as a guest. Instead, it outlines very specific criteria for the types of guests they feature, indirectly suggesting that if she doesn’t meet these requirements, they aren’t interested.

How would your advice be tailored to their unique experiences and challenges?

Importantly, I have a strong theme and premise to my podcast and I always want guests to follow this. If this doesn’t happen, then the “magic” is never created. It’s a truly passion project for me (I have a day job and have always worked in NFP’s and human services) and is primarily driven by the transcendent experiences I get from literally every story. Each episode is generally between 25 – 35 minutes and can easily be recorded over Zoom. It’s always a casual process and only the audio track is used for the episode (no vision is used). Attached is a “Guest Information sheet” that will continue to give you some understanding of the premise … which is simply … I have found the best way to approach each episode is for the guest to focus on a single experience or story within their life, … and not necessarily their overall life story. I am a big believer in ‘pivotal’ moments and situations where you experienced something very specific as being the best places to start the episodes . I’m located in Perth, Western Australia so if you able to chat over Zoom, I’ll try to fit into your availability. Please let me know what suits.

You would be a fantastic guest on the show! Passage to Profit Show is a weekly nationally syndicated radio show & podcast showcasing entrepreneurs from various backgrounds and industries. Our show is about discussing guests' entrepreneurial journeys and their innovations. We are currently syndicated on 37 radio stations across the country on the Radio America Network and on iHeartRadio. The podcast comes out after the show airs on the radio. There are 3 options to join the show as guest: 1.) Guests can join via Zoom from their location, for which there is a $100 booking fee. 2.) We offer the additional opportunity for guests who want the full studio experience to tape their show at iHeart Studios in Manhattan! Guests will have opportunities to take photos and video in the state of the art brand new iHeart Studios and with the iHeart logo. We will also create a social media video reel that they can use for their promotions from their interview. The fee for the iHeartRadio NYC taping is $250. 3.) If you are not interested in paid opportunities but interested in the show, please still let us know. We can put you on our list and keep you in mind for a last minute spot that needs to be filled (no fee!). The show does not gain a profit from the fees, rather it helps to pay for the costs of the guest’s episode to air on 37 radio stations across the country! Attached is our media kit for review. Please let us know if you are interested in any of the 3 options.",1,"Explanation: The email reply explicitly expresses interest in having Latoya as a guest.

Unfortunately, the focus of the podcast is to interview guests in the maritime industry and who are exhibiting leadership in the area of maritime decarbonisation. Based on the information on your website, it does not seem that you are working in shipping 🚢 and I am afraid that my podcast would not be a suitable platform for your story. Kind",0,"Reasoning: The reply clearly states that the podcast's focus is on guests in the maritime industry specifically related to maritime decarbonisation and that Latoya's background—as inferred from her website—does not align with this focus.

We truly appreciate your interest in being a guest on our podcast. As Stripping the Dipping is a motorsport-focused podcast, we typically feature guests who have direct experience working with motorsport teams, companies, or those who can offer insights into the industry. However, if you’re open to discussing business strategies specific to motorsport—such as how F1 teams and other racing organisations navigate challenges, build resilience, and drive success differently from other industries—we would love to explore that conversation with you. If this is something you’re interested in, we’d be happy to discuss further and schedule a time to have you on the show. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1,"Reasoning: The reply expresses openness to having Latoya on the show—specifically inviting her to discuss business strategies relevant to motorsport—and offers to ""discuss further and schedule a time"" if she's interested. This conditional invitation constitutes explicit interest in having her as a guest, thereby meeting the criteria for classification as interest (1)."

Our framework is a little unique in how we approach our interviews, as we use a talking point format that really allows our listeners to get to know the person for who they are first, and then what they do can come up organically as we go through the conversations.  I recommend listening to a couple of episodes to get a feel for how the conversations flow. You can find those here: https://www.embracinglayers.com/episodes I am booked out through the Fall already, but would love to connect with you in November as I prepare to set up recordings for Spring 2026.  Let me know if that is something you would be interested in after you've listened to some content to hear how our conversations go. Take care, and thanks so much for the work you do on behalf of and for women! I look forward to hearing from you.

Podcast Collection - https://",0,"Reasoning: Although the message expresses appreciation and says “would love to connect with you in November,” it clearly states that the show is completely booked until Fall. This defers the possibility of having Latoya on the podcast for several months, mirroring the examples where the host directs the guest to reconnect later—a clear indication per the rules for a “no interest” (deferral) response."

Message 2: From cyndal@brandfacestar.com on 2025-03-07 13:07",cyndal@brandfacestar.com,"Hello, Latoya! My name is Cyndal and I’m with our podcast booking team! We appreciate the outreach and interest in Be BOLD Branding! Tonya and Michael personally hold small group calls for people interested in appearing, where they can learn about your story and who you serve . That helps us both in 2 ways. 1-we get to know you and where you story would best fit in the line-up and 2-sometimes candidates meet potential clients on those calls! We also belong to an ENTIRE NETWORK of top level podcasters who are looking for great guests. We can make introductions to other hosts after the call (that fit the audience you want to reach) to help you gain more visibility. OK, I say all of that to let you know that it is NOT a prerequisite to becoming a client of ours in order to be interviewed, although that happens pretty often. :) If we can be helpful to you GREAT. If not, Tonya or Michael probably know someone who can (We have a huge network of highly successful problem solvers like them). If that sounds good…here’s a little more info about us. Our 𝘉𝘦 𝘉𝘖𝘓𝘋 𝘉𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 podcast features coaches/consultants who have bold ‘behind the business’ stories. People we work with tend to have their hands in multiple projects (coaching, podcasting, speaking, writing, etc) but they’re not nearly as profitable as they should be. That’s why we build 𝘱𝘳𝘰𝘧𝘪𝘵𝘢𝘣𝘭𝘦 𝘱𝘦𝘳𝘴𝘰𝘯𝘢𝘭 𝘣𝘳𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘴 (it’s all we do) and most of our clients walk away charging at least 60% more for their services. For now, though…please use this link and schedule a call so Tonya can hear your story and see how it fits in the line-up! https://go.oncehub.com/VIPPodguest Cyndal Dunn- Be BOLD Branding Booking Agent Cyndal",1,"Reasoning: The email reply is clearly demonstrating interest. It provides a scheduling link inviting Latoya to book a call with Tonya, outlines a process to learn her story, and offers additional introductions to other podcast hosts—all of which are indicators of interest per the specified criteria."

A couple things about the Power of Partnership podcast. Our guests are all deeply influenced and impacted by the work of Dr. Riane Eisler. You can listen to Episode 1 of the series to learn more about her work and then to see if you would still be interested in being a guest (i.e., meaning her work is deeply embedded in your philosophy and approach to the work that you do). Second, the PoP podcast is a project of The Center for Partnership Systems which is a 501-c-3 non-profit and not able to pay our podcast casts. Best, Cherri",1,"The email does not flat out reject Latoya’s request. Instead, it outlines specific criteria for potential guests—namely, that their work must be deeply influenced by Dr. Riane Eisler. It invites Latoya to listen to an episode to determine if her work aligns with that influence, which is a conditional but clear indication of interest. Additionally, it clarifies that the podcast is a non-profit, meaning no compensation is available, but that detail is informational rather than a rejection. Overall, the reply shows interest if Latoya's work truly parallels the podcast’s focus."

Does it roll up to the UN Sustainable Development Goals 2. Are they introducing system level change into their chosen area? 2. Is there a specific, bold innovation that underpins how they are doing this A great example would be amber electric ( https://www.shapethesystem.org/episodes/dan-adams-co-ceo-co-founder-of-amber-electric ) 1. Rolls up to energy, sustainable, environmental 2. They have created an alternative model for retail energy where customers get access to wholesale energy prices, meaning they can use the cheap, plentiful renewable energy when its available and curtail energy usage 3. They introduced a combination of smart meters and app to enable real time monitoring of the volatile energy prices and device management which would automatically turn off high energy devices such as pool pumps or car charging at peak prices (and on at low prices) The innovation doesn't have to be technology it could regulatory, behavioural, business model .. as long as it's a key to the system they are rethinking If it is super strong in all 3 this is ideal, but if the innovation is not that strong or we aren't seeing it as introducing system level change then we may decline it on this basis. So with this revised more narrow criteria unfortunately this won't be a fit for the show. We previously had a specialist format where we interviewed people operating in the space more broadly in specific verticals (marketing, pr, strategy, comms etc etc) but it didn't land that well so we went back to our core format above Thanks for your understanding Vincent ᐧ",0,"This email clearly outlines very specific criteria for guest selection and ultimately states that Latoya's request ""won't be a fit for the show."" The definitive rejection language and lack of any invitation for further discussion or alternative arrangement means it should be classified as ""NO INTEREST."""

We appreciate your interest in sharing your stories with our audience. We are more than a podcast; we are a digital TV show and work with many PR agencies like yours. I saw that you guarantee features, which is amazing. We have had the pleasure of hosting remarkable guests such as Gary Vaynerchuk, Rob Dyrdek, the Founder of Reebok, Shelley Zalis, Codie Sanchez, Will.i.am , Ryan Serhant, Trevor Wallace, and many others. Our show airs digitally for Pix11 NYC and Fox5 in San Diego, providing significant exposure to our featured guests. We charge a one-time booking fee for interviews to maintain our program's high quality and reach. Here’s how it works: Interview Duration and Format: Each interview lasts 8-10 minutes and is conducted virtually for convenience. In-person option available. Online Presence: The interview will be on the site of Pix11 NYC or Fox5 in San Diego. Additionally, it will be featured on our social media channels. Podcast: We share selected audio on our podcast. These are not guaranteed and not paid for. Post-Production: Once the interview is completed, it will be posted within 5-7 days, pending your approval. Additional Opportunities: We can assist in getting your company booked on over 150 TV stations to further enhance their visibility. We would love to talk about this opportunity more if it aligns with your goals. Please let us know a suitable time for a call to go over the details and next steps. You can schedule a call using this link: Calendly Link . We look forward to the possibility of featuring on 'Founder's Story.'",1,"Reasoning: The email expresses interest by offering a detailed booking opportunity, providing a scheduling link (Calendly) for setting up a call, and outlining the paid process for appearing as a guest.
