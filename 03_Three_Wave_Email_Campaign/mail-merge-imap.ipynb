      "Running LLM-based interest classification on replies...\n",
      "  Classified She's Not Done Yet - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: Although the podcast is currently on hiatus, the reply indicates that Latoya’s request will be revisited (\"I've marked your email as unread so I can return to it once I start the podcast up again\"), which meets the criteria of reviewing the request in the future. This deferred consideration shows interest rather than an outright rejection.)\n",
      "  Classified The Rundown with Ramon - Interest: 0 (The reply doesn't actively express a commitment to having Latoya on the show. Instead, it explains that the sender is currently undergoing restructuring and asks her to \"keep in touch\" and \"touch base ... in the coming weeks.\" This deferral—along with the promotion of another show—aligns with the rule for no interest (i.e., directing Latoya to reconnect after a period rather than extending an immediate invitation).)\n",
      "  Classified Everyday Celebrity Podcast - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The reply shows clear interest in having Latoya as a guest by stating \"I would love to sit down with you\" and even asks a qualifying question (\"Are you based in California?\"). This direct invitation and inquiry fall under the examples of interest detailed in the guidelines.)\n",
      "  Classified Preconceived - Interest: 0 (Reasoning: The reply clearly states \"We aren’t booking new guests at this time,\" which is a definitive rejection without any indication of future interest or follow-up inquiries.)\n",
      "  Classified nuBeginning: Inspiration for you! - Interest: 1 (The reply expresses clear interest with phrases like \"Yes, I would be interested. Let us talk,\" and includes a link for further action, which aligns with the criteria for coding as \"INTEREST.\")\n",
      "  Classified Mastering Tech Growth - Interest: 1 (Explanation: The reply asks several follow‐up questions (e.g., where she discovered the show, what keywords she used, and how she decided on a good match) which qualifies as a request for more information. According to the guidelines, any request for additional details indicates interest. There's no indication of a rejection or redirecting her request, so the response is coded as interest (1).)\n",
      "  Classified The Talent Forge: Shaping the Future of Training and Development with Jay Johnson - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The email expresses interest by stating that the conversation could be interesting, provides a scheduling link for booking, and refers Latoya to a team member who handles the booking process. These elements clearly meet the criteria for \"interest.\")\n",
      "  Classified Fintech Impact - Interest: 0 (Explanation: The reply explicitly states that they are not booking guests for the next several months, which falls under definitive rejection language. Although it includes a link to a form for consideration, the primary message is that they are not accepting guests at the moment, which meets the criteria for \"no interest.\")\n",
      "  Classified Land The Talk - Interest: 1 (This reply clearly indicates interest. The sender invites Latoya to book a date using the provided Calendly link, which shows they are open to having her on the show. There is no rejection language, only a positive, actionable invitation.)\n",
      "  Classified The Indie Startup Podcast - Interest: 0 (Reasoning: The reply doesn’t include any indication of interest in booking Latoya as a guest. Instead, it only asks “Are you a bot?”—a question aimed at verifying authenticity rather than exploring guest details, scheduling, or showing genuine interest in her qualifications. This dismissive response, along with its self-promotion, aligns with the “No Interest” criteria.)\n",
      "  Classified Much More Muchier with Pup Duffy & Keira Lane - Interest: 1 (The email clearly expresses interest by stating \"Would love to have you on\" and asks for Latoya's availability, which directly indicates a desire to have her as a guest on the show.)\n",
      "  Classified Making Our World Better - Interest: 1 (The reply asks Latoya to send her CV—a request for additional information about her qualifications—which fits the criteria for interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Rob Tobias: TRAIN OF THOUGHT - Interest: 1 (The reply asks if Latoya is local in Eugene and expresses interest in discussing further, which qualifies as a question about her qualifications and indicates further engagement.)\n",
      "  Classified Building the Premier Accounting Firm - Interest: 0 (The reply explicitly states they are fully booked through July and have paused new bookings, which clearly rejects any interest in having Latoya as a guest at this time.)\n",
      "  Classified Road to Revenue | Geniuslink - Interest: 0 (The reply clearly states that the podcast only features guests with direct experience in the creator economy. Since Latoya doesn’t appear to meet that criterion based on her website, the email is effectively a rejection rather than an expression of interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Mauricio Mejia LIVE - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The reply asks Latoya’s location (\"Where are you located?\") and expresses clear interest in having her on the show (\"I'd love to showcase you on my show\") while suggesting to schedule a call. These elements match the criteria for showing interest.)\n",
      "  Classified No-Problem Parenting - Interest: 0 (Reasoning: The reply is a direct, dismissive rejection without any invitation, further questions, or additional engagement. It clearly states \"No thank you,\" which is indicative of a definitive rejection rather than showing any interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Scale You Podcast - Interest: 1 (This reply expresses interest by providing an application form and instructing Latoya to fill it out so the team can assess her fit for the show, which aligns with the criteria for an \"INTEREST\" response.)\n",
      "  Classified Michigan Liberation’s Respect the Roots Podcast - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The reply expresses clear interest in having Latoya on the podcast by stating that her expertise aligns with the show's content and by inviting her to schedule a one-on-one conversation to discuss further. The use of scheduling links and a direct invitation to participate clearly meet the criteria for an \"interest\" response.)\n",
      "  Classified Master Your Life : Beyond the Boardroom - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The email expresses interest in having Latoya on the show by stating an openness to guests like her, suggesting a conversation to see if there's a fit, and asking for her availability and time zone to connect. Although it mentions a wait until May, it does not reject her outright but rather invites further discussion, which qualifies as an indication of interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Focus on Growth: Sage Insights - Interest: 1 (Explanation: The email clearly shows interest by stating “I’m happy to talk” and requests additional information by asking Latoya to send some bio info. This qualifies as a request for more information, which aligns with the criteria for interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Anglotopia Podcast - Interest: 0 (Reasoning: The email dismissively states \"This is not a topic we would cover,\" which is a clear rejection. There is no indication of future interest or any invitation for further dialogue about Latoya being on the show.)\n",
      "  Classified Forty Drinks: The Podcast About Turning 40 - Interest: 1 (The email expresses genuine interest. It asks if Latoya has listened to an episode (a qualifying question) and invites her to share her personal \"forty story\" details to determine if an introductory chat should follow—indicating the sender is interested in potentially having her on the show.)\n",
      "  Classified Mess and Meaning - Interest: 1 (Explanation: Although Kara mentioned that she’s currently taking time off from the podcast, she also stated she would review Latoya’s content and reach out in the future if it fits her podcast topics. This future consideration qualifies as interest based on the guidelines.)\n",
      "  Classified MindShift Power Podcast - Interest: 1 (The reply asks follow‑up questions about Latoya’s qualifications (e.g., her experience with engaging youth and evidence of speaking skills) and offers contact details for further discussion. This meets the criteria for an expression of interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Keep it Humane - Interest: 1 (This reply is asking for additional information about the guest’s connection to the Animal Welfare field and how they might be a good fit for the program, which qualifies as an interest.)\n",
      "  Classified The Stash Cast - Interesting Conversations with Interesting People - Interest: 1 (This reply shows interest because it provides a scheduling link to set up a pre-call, indicating the sender wants to discuss further and game plan how Latoya can be a guest.)\n",
      "  Classified Sales POP! Podcasts - Interest: 1 (Explanation: The reply directs Latoya to Claudia— a team member responsible for the podcast interview process—and invites her to ask any questions about the interview requirements. This referral and offer of additional information show an active interest in potentially having her as a guest.)\n",
      "  Classified ENYTinG Gender Podcast - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The reply includes a scheduling link and directs Latoya to an opportunity (the Transforming Lives Panel Podcast), which counts as providing contact/scheduling information. Despite not inviting her on the originally inquired ENYTinG Gender podcast, the response still actively engages her by referring her to a podcast where she might be a great fit, meeting the criteria for \"interest.\")\n",
      "  Classified Casual Temple - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The email is enthusiastic and explicitly offers scheduling links for the guest interview, indicating a clear interest in having Latoya on the show. It provides contact information and scheduling options, which qualifies as an \"interest\" response.)\n",
      "  Classified The R and B Bistro UP Close and Personal - Interest: 1 (The reply asks Latoya, \"where you are located\" and proposes a package that includes an interview as an addition to a paid option, which qualifies as offering a way for her to appear on the show. Both the location question and the paid option meet the criteria for interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Kickin Shit With Rich - Interest: 1 (The reply, \"You could be a guest,\" explicitly invites Latoya to be on the show. This indicates clear interest and matches the criteria for code 1.)\n",
      "  Classified Think Business with Tyler - Interest: 0 (The email explicitly states that the suggested guest doesn't meet the show's criteria and is not a fit, which clearly indicates no interest. There are no questions, further information requests, or alternative offers—only a rejection with reasons why.)\n",
      "  Classified GentleMan Style Podcast-God, Family, Finance, Self - Interest: 0 (The email reply simply states \"Not at this time,\" which is a clear rejection and does not contain any questions, follow-up information, or expressions of interest.)\n",
      "  Classified Multiply Your Success with Dr. Tom DuFore - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: The email indicates continued interest in Latoya as a podcast guest by adding her request to the review list, asking for additional materials (biosheet or onesheet), and promising to follow up with next steps, which aligns with the criteria for an \"interest\" response.)\n",
      "  Classified Life as a.. - Interest: 1 (Reasoning: Although the reply notes that similar guests have been featured recently and it isn’t a good fit right now, the sender includes \"Perhaps down the line, I could explore this opportunity further,\" which counts as mentioning a potential future review of the request. That future consideration meets the criteria for an \"interest\" response.)\n",
      "  Classified Hearing the Council - Interest: 0 (This reply explicitly states that they only book guests who are members of the DC Council, effectively rejecting Latoya's request without leaving room for further inquiry or consideration.)\n",
      "  Classified USAFBL Fingerboarding Podcast - Interest: 1 (The reply expresses interest in having Latoya on the podcast—it invites her to join if she meets the criteria and asks for additional information about her portfolio and social media.

      "  Classified Zen and the Art of Real Estate Investing - Interest: 0 (Explanation: The reply clearly states that the show only features guests with a real estate investing background and a portfolio, which essentially disqualifies guests who don’t meet these specific criteria. The email is a canned response and not an invitation for Latoya to appear on the show, making it a clear rejection in line with the “NO INTEREST” guidelines.)\n",
      "  Classified Computer Says Maybe - Interest: 0 (Reasoning: The email explicitly rejects the request by stating that Latoya's pitch \"wouldn't be a good fit for us.\" It is a brief, definitive rejection without any questions, offers, or invitations for further discussion.)\n",
      "  Classified Voice2Change - Interest: 1 (The email states, \"I will certainly share your email with my team for consideration,\" which indicates that Latoya's request will be reviewed.

LinkedIn or web pages talking more about what you do\"), which qualifies as a request for more information under the given interest criteria.)\n",
      "  Classified AT HOME with Byron Katie • The Work of Byron Katie® Podcast - Interest: 0 (The reply doesn't express any interest in having Latoya as a guest. Instead, it explains that Byron Katie's podcast is recorded live during existing events and directs her to register for those events rather than discussing a direct guest appearance. This approach falls squarely under a rejection by providing an alternative service rather than considering her for a guest spot.)\n",
      "  Classified Up Until Now, Your Next Chapter with Zelda - Interest: 1 (The reply shows clear interest in having Latoya as a guest. It not only expresses enthusiasm but also asks for available dates and times to schedule a chat, confirming her eligibility for the show.)\n",

These questions show that the sender is evaluating the suitability of the request rather than outright rejecting it.)\n",
      "  Classified The Deep Specialization™️ Podcast - Interest: 0 (The email clearly states that they are not moving forward with the opportunity at this time, making it a definitive rejection rather than an indication of interest. There are no questions, follow-up offers, or alternative opportunities mentioned.)\n",

    "• ANY question is asked about Latoya or her qualifications (e.g., \"Are you local?\" \"Are you a Rotarian?\")\n",
    "• ANY request for more information, no matter how brief (e.g., \"Where can I find more info?\")\n",
    "• Provides application forms, scheduling links, or contact information\n",
    "• Mentions reviewing her request in the future\n",
    "• Refers Latoya to a team member who handles booking\n",
    "• Offers a paid option for appearing as a guest\n",
    "• Explicitly wants to have Latoya on the show\n",
    "\n",
    "Code as 0 (NO INTEREST) if:\n",
    "• Explicitly states they are \"not taking guests\" or \"not taking open solicitation for guests\"\n",
    "• Says they are fully booked for MONTHS ahead (beyond 6-8 weeks)\n",
    "• Directs Latoya to reconnect after a long period (like \"connect with me again in mid-late April\")\n",
    "• Offers an alternative SERVICE instead of a guest spot (like \"white label podcasting service\")\n",
    "• Clearly states their show only features specific types of guests that Latoya doesn't match\n",
    "• Uses definitive rejection language like \"this wouldn't be the right fit for our show\"\n",
    "• Responds with dismissive brevity (not including questions)\n",
    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT EXAMPLES:\n",
    "These brief questions are ALL interest (code 1):\n",
    "• \"Are you local?\"\n",
    "• \"Are you a Rotarian?\"\n",
    "• \"Where can I find more info?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "These are rejections (code 0):\n",
    "• \"At this time, we are not taking open solicitation for guests. But you should know that we offer podcasting as a service...\"\n",
    "• \"Unfortunately, the show is fully booked through May, 2025... please make a note to connect with me again in mid-late April.\"\n",
